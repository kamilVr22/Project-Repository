Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, today, visited the Tel Nof Air Base, where he met with the personnel of the 133rd Squadron, which operates F-15s.
The Prime Minister was briefed by the deputy base commander and the squadron commander on its activity during the war.
Prime Minister Netanyahu:
""We are in challenging times. We are in the midst of the war in Gaza, which is continuing at full force, even as we are continuing our relentless efforts to return our hostages. However, we are also prepared for scenarios involving challenges in other sectors. We have determined a simple rule: Whoever harms us, we will harm them. We are prepared to meet all of the security needs of the State of Israel, both defensively and offensively. 
The people of Israel and I rely on you; may we all have great success.""

09.04.2024,"At the start of his visit, the Prime Minister was briefed on enlistment data in the shadow of the war and was impressed by the recruits' great motivation to serve in the IDF in general, and in combat positions in particular. He then spoke with the new recruits and answered their questions.
Prime Minister Netanyahu joined the new recruits for lunch and heard from them about the induction process.
Prime Minister Netanyahu to the recruits [translated from Hebrew]:
""This is a very significant day in your lives and in the life of the state. The state exists thanks to our ability to defend ourselves. These attacks have not ceased since we established the state; this has been the fate of the Jewish people for hundreds and even thousands of years. What changed with the establishment of the state is our ability to repel these attacks, sometimes at a very heavy cost, but with a strength that the entire world understands, may not always like, but we know that without it we would not exist.
This is what you are doing here today, in the various units, brigades and corps. We are, in effect, defending the existence of our state, which is also the personal existence of each and every one of you, your families, your friends and also the coming generations. This is no exaggeration or lofty words. These are very precise words; this is what will determine if our state exists.
The most prominent thing that we have seen in the six months since the outbreak of the war is the immense increase in the motivation of the young people, the desire to enlist, defend and fight, both young men and young women. We have never seen such a thing. This attests to the power of the life in our people. I think that you deserve all praise as well as the understanding that you are – in effect – doing something of historic significance.""
Prime Minister Netanyahu added, about the fighting in the Gaza Strip [translated from Hebrew]:
""We will complete the elimination of Hamas's battalions, including in Rafah. No force in the world will stop us. There are many forces trying to do this but it will not help because this enemy, after what it has done, will not do this again. Neither will it exist. We are committed to doing this, and each one of you now, at this base, will contribute in one way or another to completing the goal. This must be. After doing such a thing to our country – it will not be done any more.
We have three objectives: One – to return our hostages, all of the field observers, and not just them, but everyone together. We will return them all. The second objective: Eliminating Hamas. The third objective: To ensure that Gaza will never again constitute a threat to Israel.
There is a fourth objective: Hamas is part of Iran's axis of evil, which aims to destroy us. And when we defeat Hamas, it is not only defeating Hamas – it is defeating the axis. Everyone in the Middle East and beyond is sitting in the stands and watching who will win on this field, Israel or Iran and its proxies. You already know who will win. Good luck!""
Also participating in the visit were the Prime Minister's Chief-of-Staff, the Prime Minister's Military Secretary, the Head of the IDF Personnel Branch, the commander of the Border Defense School and additional senior IDF officers."
01.04.2024,"Following are Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's remarks at his press conference, this evening, at the Prime Minister's Office in Jerusalem ""Citizens of Israel, I would like to commend the action of the IDF and the ISA in Shifa. Last week, our forces operated there in exemplary fashion. Shifa has become a main terrorism command center for Hamas. The surprise action by our forces was precise and surgical. They eliminated over 100 terrorists, including senior commanders, and additional terrorists surrendered. No hospital anywhere in the world looks like this; this was a terrorist lair.
The important information that our forces obtained during the operation will assist them in locating our hostages and in preparing for the continuation of the fighting. Indeed, we are continuing operations in the Strip, in Lebanon and far afield as well.
At the same time, I have approved the IDF operational plan for Rafah. The IDF is prepared for the evacuation of the civilian population and for the provision of humanitarian assistance. This is the right thing both operationally and internationally. This will take time but it will be done. We will enter Rafah and we will eliminate the Hamas battalions there for one simple reason: There is no victory without entering Rafah and there is no victory without eliminating the Hamas battalions there. This is a fundamental part of the goals of the war, which also include returning all of our hostages.
I would like to tell you that the distress and the pain of the hostages' families rends my heart. I think that they rend all of our hearts. It is difficult to imagine the anguish of the families that are concerned about the fate of their loved ones, the tribulations of not knowing and of endless worrying. Their loved ones are our loved ones, the hostages.
Amit Soussana and additional female hostages have given chilling testimony of the harsh sexual abuse that was perpetrated on them. This testimony is infuriating as is the silence of global women's organizations, a silence that screams to high heaven.
Last Thursday and today, I met again with the families of the hostages, together with my wife Sara. My wife sent a letter to the mother of the Emir of Qatar, the Sheikha Moza. I still await her response.
We listened to the families and embraced them. I understand their distress and desire to do everything to return the hostages and I fully share this desire.
As Prime Minister of Israel, I am doing everything, and will do everything, to bring our loved ones back home. Our efforts to return the hostages are continuing all the time. Whenever precise intelligence information comes in and operational conditions allow it, I approve rescue operations, which entail risk to the lives of our heroic fighters, who join in the mission. To my joy, there have also been successes.
But most of our action is a combination of military pressure and determined negotiations, which has already led to the release by our forces and our efforts, of approximately half of the hostages. Together with the negotiating team and the Cabinet, I am working around the clock to free all of our hostages. I am doing so while balancing between the necessary pressure on Hamas and the flexibility that is possible in the negotiations.
Whoever says that I am not doing everything to return our hostages – is mistaken and is misleading others. Whoever knows the truth and still repeats this lie is causing unnecessary pain to the hostages' families.
The truth is that when Israel shows flexibility in the negotiations, Hamas hardens its positions. Hamas is demanding the cancellation of the corridor and the unsupervised return of Gazans – including Hamas terrorists – to the northern Strip. These demands by Hamas have security ramifications that I will not detail here. With all of the difficulty that this entails, the negotiations must be conducted with level-headedness and prudent determination. This is the only way to return our hostages – all of our hostages.
The claim that if we agree to more and more concessions every two days, that this will lead to a deal, is the opposite of the truth. Such an approach in the negotiations will not bring release closer but push it further away. The test of the results is not in our seeing that we are making efforts to reach a deal, but in achieving release, in the actual return of our hostages back home.
I would like to say something else. Calls for elections now during the war, a moment before victory, will paralyze Israel for at least six months; in my estimate, for eight months. They will paralyze the negotiations for the release of our hostages and in the end will lead to ending the war before achieving its goals and the first to commend this will be Hamas, and that says it all.
I reiterate: I am committed to returning all of our hostages, women and men, civilians and soldiers, the living and the victims. I will not leave even one behind.
With God's help, we will be successful. Together we will fight and together we will win."""
28.03.2024,"Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, today, at the Prime Minister's Office in Jerusalem, met with a democratic US Congressional delegation, organized by AIPAC.
The Prime Minister welcomed the members of the delegation on their arrival and thanked them for the broad support for the State of the Israel among the American public. He also briefed them on the fighting in the Gaza Strip and answered their questions.
Prime Minister Netanyahu to the US Congressional delegation:
""I'm delighted to see all of you. You've been long-time friends of Israel. You're great supporters. It's very important for us to maintain bipartisan support at all times, but especially in these trying times. I want to use this opportunity of our conversation to try to straighten out and also dispel some of the things that are being said about our bipartisan alliance and the importance of maintaining it.
I don't know if you know this, but I think it was about a week ago or two weeks ago. Iran officially launched, along with Hezbollah, a campaign, which means Hamas, the Houthis and so on, but the formal policy is to shift from an ideological position of destroying Israel to a practical, long-term plan to bring about the destruction of the state.
We have to win. There is no substitute for victory.
How do we achieve this victory? It doesn't nullify the other needs: How to take care of Hezbollah, how to take care of Iran, how to prevent Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons, which would make this threat a hundred times bigger, how to prevent these militias from firing into Israel rockets from Yemen or from Baghdad, precise rockets that could reach this room right now. How do we deal with that? These are big questions, but it starts with a necessary condition—and that condition is that those who launched this genocidal attack must be defeated.
How do you do that? What we've set out at the outset, with the support of President Biden and the administration – important support, which we appreciate deeply – was to say, the first thing: Our goal is to destroy the military and governing capabilities of Hamas in Gaza. Hamas has to be eliminated. Not as in idea. Nazism wasn't destroyed as an idea in World War Two, but Nazis do not govern Germany. There are still Neo-Nazis around, but you destroyed that organization.
The second thing was to get our hostages out. They are simultaneous goals, because the military action is what produces the pressure to release the hostages. We've released half. We intend to release all of them.
The third thing is to ensure that, indeed that Gaza doesn't pose a threat to Israel again."""
27.03.2024,"I thought the US decision in the Security Council was a very, very bad move. The worst part about it was that it encouraged Hamas to take a hard line and to believe that international pressure will prevent Israel from freeing the hostages and destroying Hamas. 
My decision not to send the delegation to Washington in the wake of that resolution was a message to Hamas: Don't bet on this pressure, it's not going to work.
I hope they got the message."
25.03.2024,"Head of IDF Manpower Maj.-Gen. Asor, Commander of the Military Police, commanders and soldiers, I am very impressed by your work at all times but especially now, when the challenges facing you have grown significantly, to put it mildly. The missions have become greater as have your efforts.
You defend the State of Israel and the citizens of Israel around the clock, in various missions, while assuming risks and sometimes with sacrifice. I want to commend you and tell you – well done. Thank you very much.
I want to thank the rabbi not only for the flawless reading but also for your important remarks regarding the reading, which were not extraneous but go to the heart of the matter.
Today we mark the holiday of Purim (https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/purim). More than 2,000 years ago in ancient Persia, an antisemitic enemy arose, the wicked Haman, who sought to wipe the Jewish people off the face of the Earth. The Jews stood up, united together, fought and won a total victory.
Today in modern Persia, there is a new enemy – the Iranian regime, which seeks to destroy the state of the Jews. We have already seen what Hamas, one of this enemy's proxies, did on October 7, which President Biden also called sheer evil.
It is impossible to defeat the sheer evil by leaving it intact in Rafah. As in ancient times, like our brothers, we are also united. We are fighting and will be victorious. We will enter Rafah and achieve total victory. We eliminated Haman and we will also eliminate Sinwar.
Happy holiday to you!"
20.03.2024,"Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, this evening, attended a meeting of the Israel Land Authority Council, chaired by Construction and Housing Minister Yitzhak Goldknopf. It was decided to expand the definition of reserve soldiers eligible for benefits so that reserve soldiers who served over 45 days during the war will also be eligible for the benefits of reserve soldiers – out of high esteem and deep appreciation for IDF reserve soldiers.
It was also decided to increase the benefits given to all reserve soldiers and determine that they will also be eligible for an additional 10% discount from the payment rates that have been determined in national preference areas. The increased regional discount will be in addition to the present discount of up to NIS 100,000 depending on the location of the land and its value. According to the decision, the discount that will be provided to reserve soldiers without housing in most communities in 'A' national preference areas will be up to 90% of the value of the land.
Prime Minister Netanyahu:
""Today is a day of good news because we have promised for some time to bring free, or almost free, land to those serving in the army, our reservists, with emphasis – of course – on combat service. There really is major good news here of 90%, and in some places even 95%. The land itself is almost free. We are aware that there are also development costs. We will now discuss how to also provide the assistance, the subsidy, in the Finance Ministry for the development costs. Of course, this is a major revolution that also makes justice.
 Our soldiers are fighting for our land and deserve part of our land. This change is welcome – it is vital for the north and the south, and for other parts of the country. How much more so because we are in the midst of a war and this war is a war for the country, and also a great effort for which we want to provide proper compensation to those who are putting themselves in danger for the existence of us all. 
Then I commend you for the decision that you are about to make. We will resolve the remaining problem. We are underway, on a new path. This is good news for those who serve. Thank you very much

19.03.2024,"Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, today, at the start of a meeting of the subcommittee on advancing the fight against crime in the Arab sector in Israel:  ""We all welcome the fact that the Arab sector in Israel is showing solidarity with our fight against Hamas. However, it must be said that the criminal organizations are continuing to strengthen, and are now using weapons that are more lethal than in the past such as claymores and LAW rockets. Therefore, the fight against the criminal organizations must be stepped up.
 To this end, today we will submit three steps: The first step is legislation against lethal war materiel. A second step is convening the 'elite team' on a weekly basis for a continuous fight against terrorism, even during the war. A third step, which will be coordinated by Roi Kahlon, is establishing an additional working team for a focused war on crime. These are the three steps.  
We will certainly discuss other items as well but we cannot neglect the war on the criminal organizations, even during the major war effort that we are making on all fronts."
19.03.2024,"Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, today, made the following remarks at the start of his meeting with the Knesset Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee:
""We are in a dual campaign – a military campaign and a diplomatic campaign. Of course, they are inter-connected, the diplomatic fight gives us the time and the resources to reach the full results of the war.
We have been fighting for over five months, this is a record in the history of Israel's wars, except for the War of Independence. We are – of course – under growing international pressure, which we are rejecting in order to achieve the goals of the war. The goals of the war are, to be succinct: The destruction or elimination of Hamas's military and governing capabilities, the release of all of our hostages and ensuring that Gaza never again constitutes a threat to Israel.
In order to do this, we need to complete the military elimination of Hamas. There is no alternative to this. We cannot go around it; neither can we say 'We will destroy 80% of Hamas and leave 20%', because from that 20%, they will reorganize and take over the Strip again and – of course – constitute a new threat to Israel. And of course, this will be a victory for the greater axis that threatens us – the Iranian axis.
Therefore, we are determined to complete the elimination of Hamas. This requires the elimination of the remaining battalions in Rafah and – of course – the 1.5 battalions in the camps in the center. We are determined to do this. We have a debate that I will put on the table, and we all know it. US National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan also said this yesterday. We have a debate with the Americans over the need to enter Rafah, not over the need to eliminate Hamas, but the need to enter Rafah. We see no way to eliminate Hamas militarily without destroying these remaining battalions. We are determined to do this.
Out of respect for the President, we agreed on a way in which they can present us with their ideas, especially on the humanitarian side; of course, we fully share this desire to facilitate an orderly exit of the population and the providing of humanitarian aid to the civilian population. We have been doing this since the beginning of the war.
However, I made it as clear as possible to the President that we are determined to complete the elimination of these battalions in Rafah, and there is no way to do this without a ground incursion."
18.03.2024,"Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, today, at the Prime Minister's Office in Jerusalem, met with an AIPAC leadership delegation led by AIPAC President Michael Tuchin. The Prime Minister spoke with the delegation, briefed them on the fighting in Gaza, and answered their questions.
Following are excerpts from the Prime Minister's remarks:
""How do we define victory? We define it as the destruction of Hamas's military and governing capabilities, as the return of the hostages, which we're working right now, and also as preventing the return, Gaza from becoming a threat to Israel at any time in the future.
There is also the northern front, where we want to return our people to a condition of security. That requires that Hezbollah move back. That is also part of our goals, which we will not give up on. Very important. 
If we achieve these goals, then we will also deliver a stinging blow to the Iran terror axis, which is behind everything that we're seeing here today.
That is something that we all have to understand, that this is not just Israel's battle. It is a battle for our future, but it's also the battle for the victory of the Israel-America-moderate Arab axis against the Iran axis. 
Unless we have that victory that I talked about, then we have a defeat. A defeat spells terrible things for our future and for the future of the Middle East and beyond the Middle East. Because this is a war of civilization against barbarism, those who want to bring back the Middle East to the Middle Ages, early Middle Ages, and those who want to see it going to the century of progress and advance in the 21st century. That's really the battle. It's a very, very big battle.""
Prime Minister Netanyahu added:
""The picture that is presented in the last few days and weeks in the United States is completely different from what I described. It's not the unity of the people. You can go into any cab, go into a mall, walk down the street and talk to people. The great majority will tell you that they support what I just said, the goals that the government has set.
That's not the description you have an outlier prime minister who put some extreme fringe groups, and that's what's driving the policy. False. I would say deliberately false. They know it's false. But that falsehood is perpetrated and it's wrong.
There is unity among the people to achieve victory along the lines that I described. It is within reach and we're going to do it. I've said this to the president. I've said it to the people that I've talked to. They keep saying that local politics is interfering with this. They may be right. On which side of the pond?
We have to win this war. We have to stand together and win this war. We have to stand together here, and we have to stand together there. Because it's the right thing to do. Because it's the necessary thing to do. Because it's the one thing that will assure the viability, future and security of the State of Israel"
17.03.2024,"Chancellor Scholz, welcome to you and your delegation. This is the third visit that you are taking as chancellor to Israel, the second visit during the war. We very much appreciate your friendship, the support that Germany has given Israel during these trying times.
We've just had a very serious conversation, an important conversation among friends. You expressed your concern for two things. One, protecting civilians, and second, provision of humanitarian aid. I explained that these are our concerns as well because we agree with both goals. In fact, the army of Israel has done more to minimize civilian casualties than any other army in modern times, and certainly any other army faced with such dense urban warfare and an enemy that seeks to use civilians as human shields, as Hamas does, often at gunpoint.
Secondly, we are doing unusual efforts to increase humanitarian aid by land, by sea, by air, and we'll continue to do more. The main problem that we see is the distribution of this aid once it gets into Gaza, and the fact that it is being looted by Hamas and by others. This is something that we have to have a joint effort to try to prevent. The responsibility for this disruption and for the civilian casualties should be laid at Hamas's door. Israel will do whatever it can to minimize those casualties and maximize humanitarian aid as needed.
We also agree that Hamas has to be eliminated. We cannot have a future for Gaza, a future for peace, a future for Israel if Hamas, a terrorist organization committed to our genocide, remains intact. If it remains intact, it will regroup and reconquer the Gaza Strip and, as they vowed, repeat the massacre again and again and again.
On Thursday, I met families of hostages. One of the hostages, a woman, told me that her captors, she was there with her children, and we got her out. She said the Hamas captor who held her hostage said to her: You know, you're going back now. I suggest you go. Go anywhere, go to California, leave Israel because we will do next time ten times what we did to you now. And after that, even more.
So, we cannot have this genocidal organization that murdered over a thousand Israelis, we cannot have them in power. We cannot have peace if Hamas is there. Hamas has to be eliminated for any possibility of peace and progress.
When we talked briefly also about the day after Hamas, the one thing that I would stress is it's got to be the day after Hamas, after Hamas is eliminated. That will open up other possibilities but none can be realized unless Hamas is eliminated.""
Prime Minister Netanyahu added:
""I trust you know that Israel seeks peace, and Israelis believe, all Israelis pray and yearn for peace because we suffer the consequences of war, both as a nation and as families who lost loved ones.
The cost of war is well-known to us. We believe that the key to peace is security. Many believe that the key to security is peace. But peace is unsustainable without a strong Israel. And if we are offered a peace agreement or a path to peace that makes Israel so weak and unable to defend itself, and our neighbors still adhering to the goal of destroying the Jewish state then obviously we will set peace backward and not forward.
We want to move peace forward. For that, Israel has to have the necessary security responsibility in this tiny area. Otherwise, the radicals take over. This is something that we've discussed in detail. We'll have other opportunities.
I want to assure you that we value the support that Germany has given us in international forums and elsewhere. We value your friendship and we look forward to continuing this conversation.
The other thing that I would say is that I assured Chancellor Scholz that our goal in eliminating the remaining terrorist battalions in Rafah goes hand in hand with enabling the civilian population to leave Rafah. It's not something that we will do while keeping the population locked in place. In fact, we'll do the very opposite. We'll enable them to leave because our consideration for reducing and minimizing civilian casualties has guided us, and will continue to guide us in the future.
Thank you, Chancellor and thank you all
"
14.03.2024,"We are committed to returning everyone. Even if we go to a multi-stage campaign, this includes everyone, both the casualties and the hostages.
I would be happy if I could be the bearer of good news for you today. As of this moment, there has been no real response from Hamas. They are still clinging to unacceptable demands.
They do not want to make progress. They want to ignite the ground during Ramadan. This is their attempt; this is their goal.
As a result of our pressure, the Government's, and also with your help, we are seeing – for the first time – Qatari pressure on Hamas.
I aspire to this and have been pushing for this for some time. I think that every trip and appearance of yours overseas, at the UN, in Washington, and in other capitals, has an effect. The Qatari pressure is beginning to work. Qatar has started to tell them: 'We will throw you out.' 'We will deny you funds.' This is what is being said; we have verified this. This is a change; it is something positive.
If anyone tells you that I do not want a deal, and that we are trying not to make one – this is nonsense.
At the moment there is a change in the Qatari pressure. This is the most positive thing I can say."
14.03.2024,"Unit Commander Lt.-Col. G briefed the Prime Minister on the efforts of the largest battalion in the IDF, both the combat intelligence soldiers and the work of the field observers who serve as the eyes of all Central Command sectors – the Judea and Samaria Division and the Jordan Valley Brigade.
Prime Minister Netanyahu observed an exhibition of the unit's field intelligence and combat equipment, including UAVs and war materiel. He also spoke with the soldiers and field observers, who told him about their activity in the fighting in Gaza, and in Judea and Samaria.
Prime Minister Netanyahu to the soldiers and field observers [translated from Hebrew]:
""The development of your work is very impressive. It greatly assists the combat forces and it strikes the enemy. In effect, you are the eyes of the fighting force, and this gives a tremendous advantage. First of all, I would like to thank you and your commander for the important work.
Your friends are still being held hostage by Hamas. We are doing everything to free them and the other hostages. This is a sacred mission; your mission is also sacred. We are determined to win – to achieve total victory.
Even as you and the IDF are preparing to continue fighting, there is international pressure to prevent us from entering Rafah and completing the work. As Prime Minister of Israel, I reject this pressure. We have been doing this successfully for five months already; this is record time in the history of Israel's wars. I will continue to reject the pressure. We will enter Rafah. We will complete the elimination of Hamas's battalions. We will restore security and we will bring total victory for the people of Israel and State of Israel.
I would like to thank you for your important part in this. Thank you very much. Keep observing, flying and attacking.

13.03.2024,"Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, today, at the Prime Minister's Office in Jerusalem, met with Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte.
During the meeting, their fourth since the outbreak of the war, Prime Minister Netanyahu emphasized that entering Rafah was essential for realizing the goals of the war and that unilateral recognition of a Palestinian state would be considered an achievement for Hamas.
The sides also discussed the humanitarian aid issue; Prime Minister Netanyahu called on his Dutch counterpart to join the maritime corridor initiative.
Prime Minister Netanyahu also emphasized that Israel is determined to replace UNRWA in the Gaza Strip without hindering the aid and thanked Dutch Prime Minister Rutte for freezing the financing for the agency.

11.03.2024,"Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, today, at the Prime Minister's Office in Jerusalem, met with Indian National Security Advisor Ajit Doval and updated him on recent developments in the fighting in the Gaza Strip. The sides also discussed the effort to release the hostages and the issue of humanitarian assistance.
The Director of the National Security Council, the Prime Minister's Foreign Policy Advisor and the Indian Ambassador to Israel also participated in the meeting."
04.03.2024,"Dear citizens of Israel,
At the start of my remarks, I would like to send condolences to the families of those who were murdered in the abhorrent terrorist attack near Eli, may G-d avenge them. Since the start of the war, we have eliminated almost 400 terrorists in Judea and Samaria. The battle is still underway; it has exacted from us a heavy cost.
Since October 7, we have been conducting two campaigns: A military campaign and a diplomatic campaign. The military campaign is designed to destroy Hamas, return all of our hostages and ensure that Gaza never again constitutes a threat to Israel. The diplomatic campaign is designed to provide the military campaign with the time and resources to achieve these goals – until total victory is achieved.
For five months, my colleagues and I have been working on a daily basis with world leaders and in the global media to allow freedom of action for the IDF and the security forces. This freedom of action is unprecedented in the history of the state.
As Prime Minister of Israel, I am committed to safeguarding our existential interests in spite of the growing and increasing pressure on us. This is how my predecessors acted at decisive junctures: In the face of international opposition, David Ben-Gurion declared Israel's independence. Levi Eshkol embarked on the Six Day War and Menachem Begin ordered the attack on the Iraqi nuclear reactor. This is what I have also done as Prime Minister for many years in the face of great pressures: In the continuing fight against the Iranian nuclear program, in halting the effort to compel us to accept a Palestinian terrorist state, and in doubling the settlement enterprise in Judea and Samaria in the face of pressure to strangle us completely.
And today, together with my colleagues, I am rejecting the international pressure to end the war before we achieve all of its goals. As I said, even though this pressure is growing and increasing, our efforts are bearing fruit in the most important diplomatic arena which is, of course, the US. This week a Harvard CAPS-Harris poll was published; it determined that 82% of the American public supports Israel. That is to say that more than four out five US citizens supports us and not Hamas. This broad support gives us redoubled energy to continue the campaign until total victory.
We are taking strong action against our enemies on all fronts: In the north, we are striking Hezbollah, eliminating its and Iran's senior commanders in our region and preventing them from carrying out their murderous designs.
In the south, we are continuing to eliminate Hamas's battalions in Khan Yunis and they are also preparing for the continuation. And let it be clear to you – there will be a continuation. Victory over Hamas requires the elimination of all remaining Hamas battalions both in the center of the Strip and in Rafah. We will do so while evacuating the civilian population from the combat zones. We will do so with concern for the humanitarian needs and we will do so while respecting international law – because that is how we operate.
At the same time, we are making a relentless effort to return all of our hostages. Citizens of Israel, this is a sacred goal; we are working on it around the clock. I demand to know in advance the names of all the hostages who will be included in the outline. I have yet to receive an answer on the two questions and it is too early to say, in spite of our willingness, if we will achieve an outline for an additional release in the coming days. We are making great efforts to succeed but one thing is clear to you – we will not capitulate in the face of Hamas's delusional demands. We will not do this because if we capitulate, we will simply not be here. But as of today, thanks to the combination of military pressure and tough negotiations, we have succeeded in returning alive 112 of our hostages. We are determined to return them all. With or without an outline, we will fight until total victory.
Citizens of Israel, we are achieving the goals of the war thanks to the heroism of our fighters and the unity among us. Recently, this unity was expressed in an unprecedented Knesset vote – 99 MKs acceded to my initiative to vote against international diktat to force on us the establishment of a Palestinian state. The last time that there were 99 MKs together was 30 years ago, on the peace agreement with Jordan. When we stand together, we are very strong. Since the start of the war, we have shown amazing unity on the battlefield and in Israeli society, unity which has astounded our enemies and friends alike.
Everyone who comes here tells me, be it in a taxi or on the street, or in our meetings with various sectors, they say: 'We encounter an astounding unity here.' They see our soldiers and say: 'We encounter here a marvelous unity.' This is what foreign visitors are saying.
We must continue with this unity in order to achieve total victory. In this spirit, I am convinced that we have the power to overcome even the issue of sharing the burden and enlistment. First, we must lighten the burden of reserve duty and increase the compensation to conscripts and reservists. I do not agree with the intention to double reserve duty across the board; to increase it three- or four-fold. The IDF can continue issuing emergency call-up orders as required, according to need.
Second, I am preparing a law to dramatically compensate those leaving the military by giving great discounts on land in the Galilee, the Negev and national preference areas. I will give you an example: A discharged soldier who does not own an apartment, will receive a 90% discount on the land, and a discharged combat soldier without an apartment will receive a 95% discount, almost free. Our heroic fighters have earned this. They defended our home and they will now receive land on which to build homes.
Third, regarding enlistment. I deeply appreciate the Torah study of our ultra-orthodox brothers. I also recognize and appreciate their joining the civilian emergency and rescue organizations that are doing sacred work. However, in addition to this, I must say: One cannot ignore the sense among the public over the gap in sharing the security burden. I will tell you something else, the ultra-orthodox public also recognizes this need. It is prepared to change the situation. Therefore, we will set goals for recruiting ultra-orthodox men into the IDF and civilian service. We will also determine the ways to ensure the implementation of these goals. It is possible to achieve this arrangement without dividing the nation and without inciting against anyone.
I am certain that it is possible to secure a Knesset majority for this arrangement but one thing is clear to me: It is impossible to achieve absolute agreement. Do you know where there is absolute agreement? In North Korea. In a democracy, there is the agreement of the majority. Whoever demands absolute agreement will not achieve any agreement. It is enough that someone in the coalition is interested in going to elections, then we will be dragged into elections. It is enough that if there is an element with extremist demands on the enlistment issue – one way or the other – then we will also be dragged into elections.
And what is the significance of general elections now? General elections mean stopping the war, that is to say, the defeat of Israel. General elections mean paralyzing the country for six months, perhaps eight. Six months in which the country, the Government and the Knesset will be paralyzed and torn apart. In such a situation, the Government's hands will be tied. It will be unable to make decisions – not on the hostages, not on Rafah, not on Hezbollah, not on anything.
And not only the will the Government be paralyzed and torn apart – our soldiers will be torn apart. These are not municipal elections, in which a soldier from Hebron is in an APC together with a soldier from Ramat Hasharon. In these elections, there was no argument among them, each one looked to his own affairs. But in general elections, not only will there be arguments, there will be emotions, there will be camps, there will be defiance. This will be deadly fire inside our national APC. This must not happen to us during a war, while we are so close to victory.
Citizens of Israel, I reiterate to you that general elections during the war would mean defeat for Israel. This is the exact dream of Sinwar, Nasrallah and Iran. They are just waiting for it. I know what I am talking about. I will tell you something else: All the members of the Cabinet know what I am talking about.
Therefore, citizens of Israel, this is the time for unity. This is the time for agreements among us. Together with you, I say this evening to the leaders of the world, to both our friends and our opponents, do not mistake us. We are determined to fight to the end, until total victory.
We will always remember that all of this is achieved thanks to our soldiers. All of this is achieved thanks to the heroes of the people. I salute them for being daring, for storming forward amidst self-sacrifice, and I embrace the families of the fallen, in their unbearable pain.
At the start of the week, my wife Sara and I went to Shavei Shomron and visited the family of St.-Sgt. Neria Baleta, from the Givati Brigade Reconnaissance Unit, who fell heroically in battle in the Gaza Strip. Neria is the son of Rabbi Rahamim and Bat-Sheva, who made aliyah to Samaria from Ethiopia. Neria's grandfather was murdered in Sudan en route to Zion, and his grandson was a brave fighter who fell for Zion. We wept together with the rabbi, the father Rahamim, and the mother Bat-Sheva, as they spoke with emotion about their heroic son, who loved his people and his country.
For Neria, for all of the fallen, for the security of our future, we will continue to fight until total victory.
Together we will fight and with G-d's help, together we will win

The Prime Minister received an operational briefing from 210th Division Commander Brig.-Gen. Zion Ratzon and Alpinist Unit Commander Lt.-Col. (Res.)

Prime Minister Netanyahu to the soldiers:

In effect, we are in one battle from Gaza and Rafah to Mt. Hermon, and in between we are also fighting terrorism around the country, as happened today. First of all, I would like to send condolences to the family of the man who was murdered, and – of course – my best wishes for a recovery to the wounded.
In the south, we have one simple goal: Total victory. We are on the way to eliminating Hamas and releasing our hostages. We will not relent until we achieve total victory.
In the north, we have a simple goal: To return the residents. In order to do that, we need to restore the sense of security. In order do that, we must restore security – and this will be achieved. We will not relent here. We will achieve this in one of two ways: Militarily – if necessary; diplomatically – if possible. In any case, Hezbollah needs to understand – we will restore security. I hope that this message will be understood there.
You are part of this message. The entire people of Israel are behind you, are proud of you and believe in you."

Prime Minister Netanyahu operated a UAV and used it to monitor the skies over Gaza.

The Prime Minister spoke with the reservist and conscript soldiers and heard from them about their activity up until now, as well as their readiness to continue fighting.

Prime Minister Netanyahu to the soldiers:

""There is considerable pressure on Israel at home and abroad to stop the war before we achieve all of its goals, including a deal at any price to free the hostages. We very much want to achieve another release and we are prepared to go far but we are not prepared to pay any price, certainly not the delusional prices that Hamas is demanding of us, the meaning of which is the defeat of the State of Israel.

We are committed to continuing the war until we achieve all of its goals: Eliminating Hamas, releasing all of the hostages and ensuring that Gaza never again constitutes a threat to Israel. There is no pressure, none, that can change this"
18.02.2024,"Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, this evening, at the Museum of Tolerance in Jerusalem, addressed the Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations. Following are excerpts from his remarks:

""I've been seeing you here year after year, but this year it's different. Each year you come here to express your solidarity with the State of Israel, solidarity of the Diaspora with the Jewish state, but this year, that solidarity is particularly important, because it's an expression of unity between the Jewish people and the Jewish state, between so many of our friends around the world and the great trial that we are faced with today.""

Regarding the effort to free the hostages, Prime Minister Netanyahu said:

""The release of hostages can be achieved through strong military action and tough negotiations, very tough negotiations. That tough position has to involve the exertion of pressure. And the exertion of pressure is not merely on Hamas itself, but on those who can exert pressure on Hamas, beginning with Qatar.

Qatar can press Hamas as no one else can. They host Hamas leaders. Hamas is dependent on them financially. I urge you to press Qatar to press Hamas, because we want our hostages released.

I hope that we can achieve a deal soon, to release more of our hostages. But deal or no deal, we have to finish the job to get total victory.""

Prime Minister Netanyahu added:

""Once you destroy the battalions, there is no organized command and control structure. You're left with individual terrorists, which we mop up with ground action. 

We cannot leave a quarter of Hamas's terrorist battalions intact. No one would do that in the case of fighting ISIS. You wouldn't leave a quarter of ISIS intact in a defined territory. You wouldn't even think about that.

America finished the job with its allies, we will finish the job here, with our brave soldiers."""
12.02.2024,"Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir, together with the Inspector General of the Israel Police and the Commander of the Border Police, today , visited the Israel National Counter Terrorism Unit and met with the fighters and unit commander, who – in a rescue operation last night – returned hostages Fernando Marman and Louis Har from Rafah in Gaza.

 The Prime Minister gave an update on how he approved the complex operation several days ago and how he closely monitored the rescue operation from the ISA special operations control center.

 Prime Minister Netanyahu and Minister Ben-Gvir heard from the commanders and fighters about the dramatic moments of the rescue and the complexity of the operation, and the cooperation and integration among the various forces.

Prime Minister Netanyahu :

""This is a day of joy mixed with sadness: Joy over the release of our hostages and sadness over our fallen soldiers. However, I would like to tell you that the freeing of Louis and Fernando was one of the most successful rescue operations in the history of the State of Israel.

Several days ago, the operation was brought to me for approval and I approved it. Afterward, several hours later, I thought about three things: One, I thought about the sacred nature of the mission. Two, I thought about the risks in relation to the chances, and there were risks. Three, I thought about you, the fighters. I thought about what would happen at the decisive moment, because from experience, I know that at the breakthrough moment, the gap between victory and tragedy is a millimeter.

At 01:40 this morning, I saw you placing the charge and seconds later I heard 'We have the hostages.' You eliminated the abductors, the terrorists, and made your way back without injury – a successful operation, a perfect operation.

I would like to tell you: I am so proud of you. I am proud of you, the ISA and the IDF. You worked like a well-oiled machine. You are simply the best fighters there are. I came here to tell you this and to salute you on behalf of all citizens of Israel. You are the best in the world. Well done!"

11.02.2024,"Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and the ministers of the Government of Israel, today, visited base of the IDF Yahalom Unit where they received a security briefing on the war from IDF Chief-of-Staff Lt.-Gen. Herzi Halevi and additional commanders.

The Chief-of-Staff briefed the ministers about the combat in the Gaza Strip and discussed both the impressive military achievements to date and the plans for the continuation of the fighting. 162nd Division Commander Brig.-Gen. Itzik Cohen and Palmachim Air Base Commander Brig.-Gen. Omri Dor briefed the ministers about the combined air-ground incursion being carried out by the IDF in the Gaza Strip in a way that is without parallel in the world.

Prime Minister Netanyahu at the conclusion of the security briefing:

""First, I would like to thank the Chief-of-Staff and the commanders, also for the presentation, which is mainly about the achievements which are impressive by any international standard. The achievements of the IDF are very impressive.

We are on the way to victory. It will take time as it has been said correctly. But – contrary to what is being said –  it will not take years. It is within reach. It is a difficult battle, but one we are winning.

We want, in effect, to bring about the demilitarization of the Gaza Strip. This requires our security control and our comprehensive security responsibility over all territory west of the Jordan River, including the Gaza Strip. There is no alternative to this in the foreseeable future.

We are also saying this to the international community, and to the President of the US, and to all leaders. There is no alternative to this.

This is to say, security control will always be ours, and if this requires a presence inside, then there will be a presence inside. If it requires that we be able to go in anywhere, as the IDF is capable of going anywhere, at any time, this will be said here and this will also be the case in the future.

This requires maximum internal unity; I hope that we will succeed in preserving this.

The goal is no less than the victory we have been discussing. It is within reach. It requires that we also withstand the increasing pressure. I must tell you the truth: They are increasing, and each one of you who comes into contact with foreign elements can tell about this, each one in his or her own way.

But the most important thing is to adhere and cling to the goal – and the goal is victory. Not a half victory, not a three-quarters victory but victory over all of Hamas. I believe that with G-d's help, and with our united forces, we can achieve this. In light of what you have seen today, I think that you also are filled with confidence and pride in our soldiers, commanders and achievements.""

Prior to the briefings, the ministers visited the IDF Immanuel Base where they were shown operational presentations from the fighting in Gaza in the context of which they were briefed on the activities of the Yahalom Unit, the fighting in the underground tunnels, the activity of the 9900th Intelligence Unit and intelligence findings from inside the Gaza Strip, which serve the security forces in deriving additional intelligence to assist the progress in the fighting in Gaza.

Prime Minister Netanyahu directed that the Chief-of-Staff hold an additional security briefing focusing on the northern sector"
08.02.2024,"Tonight I want to speak to you about total victory.
 
Our security and the prospects of peace in the Middle East depend on one thing: total victory over Hamas.
 
At the start of the war, I outlined three goals: destroy Hamas, free the hostages, and ensure that Gaza doesn't pose a threat to Israel in the future.
 
Achieving these goals will ensure Israel's security and pave the way for additional historic peace agreements with our Arab neighbors.
 
But peace and security require total victory over Hamas.
 
We cannot accept anything else.
 
Can you imagine what will happen if we don't have total victory?
 
Hamas leaders have already pledged they’ll repeat the October 7th massacre over and over and over again.
 
No nation can accept that; we certainly won't.
 
Without total victory Iran and its terror proxies—Hamas, Hezbollah, the Houthis and others—will be emboldened to subvert moderate states in the Middle East; they’ll threaten the entire free world.
 
Only total victory will prevent that.
 
And total victory is within our reach.
 
Israel's military achievements are truly unprecedented. As John Spencer, head of urban warfare at West Point, noted: It took the United States and its allies nine months to defeat ISIS in Mosul. Mosul is a single city, smaller than Gaza, it doesn’t have any terror tunnels, and it had only five thousand terrorists. Yet in four months the IDF has killed, wounded or captured over twenty thousand terrorists, more than half of Hamas’s fighting force.
 
We have shattered 18 out of 24 Hamas battalions and we’re mopping up the remaining terrorists with ongoing raids.
 
Our soldiers are systematically destroying the massive underground terror tunnels. Hamas believed this was an impregnable network.
 
Yet our brave soldiers are now physically inside these tunnels. They’re demolishing rocket factories, weapons stockpiles, command and control centers, and what Hamas thought were unreachable safe houses.
 
Now, I have to tell you, we were repeatedly told by many in the international community that all this simply couldn’t be done.
 
They said that a ground offensive would not be effective, that we couldn’t enter Gaza city because it would be an abominable death trap, that we couldn’t go into the hospitals that served as Hamas headquarters without inflicting massive civilian casualties, and that we couldn’t enter the underground terror tunnels, because nobody could.
 
Yet our brave soldiers proved them all wrong on all counts.
 
Many argued that Israel’s military campaign would scuttle our ability to release the hostages. They were wrong on this one too. Military pressure led to the release of 110 hostages, and only continued military pressure will bring home the remaining hostages.
 
Our soldiers are now in Khan Yunis, Hamas’s main stronghold.
 
They’ll soon go into Rafah, Hamas’s last bastion. They will do so, as they have done up to now, by providing the civilian population safe passage to safe zones, and they’ll do so in spite of Hamas’ evil attempts to stop the civilians from leaving at gunpoint.
 
Total victory over Hamas will not take years. It will take months.
 
Victory is within reach.
 
When people talk about “the day after,” let’s be clear about one thing. It’s the day after all of Hamas is destroyed. Not half of Hamas, not ¾ of Hamas; all of Hamas.
 
Once Hamas is destroyed, we need to verify that Gaza is demilitarized, that we stamp out any attempt at the resurgence of terror.
 
History has shown that only Israel can do this by having overriding security control over Gaza.
 
What does that mean?
 
It means that Israel will be in Gaza or act in Gaza at any place and any time that is necessary to ensure that terror doesn’t rears its ugly head again.
 
Gaza must have a civilian administration staffed with those who do not support terrorism, fund terrorism or indoctrinate their children with terrorism and the goal of destroying Israel.
In fact, we should seek the very opposite--that school children in Gaza will be educated towards peace, that they’ll be educated towards coexistence.
 
Now, grant you, this will take time, but we’ve seen it happen in other parts of the world and in the Gulf states themselves.
 
We would welcome the participation of moderate Arab states in creating a different and better future for Gaza.
 
This would also require that UNRWA—which perpetuates the Palestinian refugee problem, whose schools indoctrinate Palestinian children with genocide and terror, and from whose ranks sprang a dozen terrorist murderers who participated in the October 7th massacre—this UNRWA must be replaced by responsible aid agencies.
 
We’re at a pivot of history where the region can go either in the direction of light or in the direction of darkness.
 
We won't allow Iran’s forces of darkness to win.
 
Our security and the future of the Middle East require total victory.
 
Total victory over Hamas can bring us additional gifts of peace.
 
Our doctrine of peace through strength has already brought us the Abraham Accords, and total victory will help us bring more historical peace agreements.
Hamas is the obstacle blocking a better and more peaceful Middle East, and it’s threatening Israel's security.
 
The pressure of the world should be on destroying Hamas as quickly as possible and not on preventing Israel from doing so.
 
All those who yearn for peace should support our quest for total victory.
 
Total victory for our security.
 
Total victory for peace in the region.
 
Total victory to secure our common future"

We had a conversation now discussing free markets. This is something that we both champion, and you are leading this in Argentina. We have led this in Israel. We can do a lot more together.

We share the desire for prosperity, security and peace. We know that the greatest challenge to peace in our area, but also in yours, is Iran. And we appreciate the cooperation that we are doing with you in security and diplomacy.

Your stalwart support for Israel in so many forms is deeply, deeply appreciated.

We are on the way to the total victory and we will not stop. This position represents the overwhelming majority of the people. There are all kinds of commentators who say that this isn't possible; it is important to me that you know that it is within reach.""

The members of the forum thanked the Prime Minister for his unequivocal remarks and expressed their support for him in the face of the heavy pressure from at home and abroad.

Prime Minister Netanyahu's wife Sara told the families:

""I thank you for your courage and for coming here to support the Prime Minister. Your support and your meeting with us is mutual and also important. Your children are our heroes.

They gave on October 7, under fire, and occasionally were fired upon, and treated themselves even as they saved lives – and they are doing this constantly.

Prime Minister Netanyahu:

""First, I want to welcome you and thank you for the stalwart support, consistent support that France took against the savagery from day one, your position on the ICJ and this absurd accusation of genocide against Israel, and many other things, and also the effort to help with humanitarian medical assistance, and – of course – our cooperation on the question of Lebanon. We have a lot to talk about.""

French Foreign Minister Séjourné:

""This meeting is important for us because we are at an important moment. You are familiar with France's positions, which have been consistent since you met with the President of the Republic, who has reiterated his words. France has very strongly condemned the events of October 7.

05.02.2024,"Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, today, visited the 8104th Battalion of the 179th Brigade, at the IDF Armored Corps Memorial at Latrun.

The Prime Minister spoke with battalion's company commanders, led by IDF Chief Armored Officer Brig.-Gen. Ohad Maor, and was briefed on the activity of the battalion since the outbreak of the war. He also met with the battalion's commanders and soldiers and visited the memorial for fallen soldiers of the IDF Armored Corps.

Prime Minister Netanyahu:

""I am just finishing a visit here with your commanders and you, and I am greatly impressed by your fighting spirit, unity in combat and the dedication to the goal. I told your commanders that several days ago, I received a cap with two words on it: 'Total victory.' This is the essence of our policy – total victory over Hamas.

Total victory is essential because it ensures the security of Israel. Total victory is the only way in which we can ensure additional historic peace agreements, which await. Total victory will strike a mortal blow against the axis of evil: Iran, Hezbollah, the Houthis and – of course – Hamas.

Therefore, there is no substitute for total victory. One need only to think of what would happen without total victory: The displaced will not return, the next massacre will only be a matter of time and Iran, Hezbollah and others will simply celebrate here and destroy the Middle East; therefore, there is no substitute for total victory.

After having met you and your commanders in the field in the Gaza Strip several times, I would like to tell you – I am impressed by your heroism, intensity and determination, and by our ability to achieve this victory, which is coming. By our calculation, as of today we have already destroyed – meaning, we have either killed or wounded – over half of their force. We have destroyed 18 of their 24 battalions. We are engaged in active demilitarization by conducting raids against the remaining terrorists and we are destroying the underground networks. We are on the way to total victory and I want to tell you that we are committed to it and will not give up on it. We will not stop the war without achieving this goal of total victory, which will restore security to both the south and the north.

I want to salute you; you are amazing, simply lions, there is no other word. Everyone today knows this, and the entire people stands behind you. Then be blessed and continue onward to the total victory."

""Welcome. It's good to see all of you, and I'm glad you came to see with your own eyes and hear with your own ears direct evidence of the slaughter and the savagery.

The UN has not been a stellar organization when it comes to dealing with Israel. It's often unbelievably tilted. It has the UN Human Rights Commission, so-called Human Rights Commission, that devotes an enormous part of its resolutions against Israel, and nothing against Iran or Yemen or other arenas of savagery and aggression.

Not by saying it should be a plague on both your houses. No, because Israel is fighting the war of civilization against barbarism, because Israel is responding to unbelievably brutal and unprovoked attacks and because it's doing so with the greatest effort that I see of any army to minimize civilian casualties against an enemy that is committing a double war crime of both targeting our civilians, mutilating our civilians, raping our women and men, beheading them after the rape, burning babies alive, and sundry other atrocities that the only time that we've seen anything like that directed against the Jewish people was in the Holocaust.

South Africa had the temerity to bring this to the ICJ, charging us with genocide against, really in the service of a genocidal organization. Now, the worst thing that I can say is this, that many of the charges, false and unfounded, that were leveled against us in The Hague were brought by UNRWA officials. And we have discovered in the last few weeks that UNRWA officials were complicit in the massacre.

I think it's time that the international community and the UN itself understand that UNRWA's mission has to end. UNRWA is self-perpetuating. It is self-perpetuating also in its desire to keep alive the Palestinian refugee issue. And we need to get other UN agencies and other aid agencies replacing UNRWA if we're going to solve the problem of Gaza as we intend to do. There are other agencies in the UN. There are other agencies in the world. They have to replace UNRWA.

UNRWA is totally infiltrated with Hamas. It has been in the service of Hamas and its schools, and in many other things. I say this with great regret because we hoped that there would be an objective and constructive body to offer aid. We need such a body today in Gaza. But UNRWA is not that body. It has to be replaced by some organization or organizations that will do that job.""

Israeli Ambassador to the UN Gilad Erdan said that every country that continues to fund UNRWA before a comprehensive investigation of the organization needs to know that its funds will serve terrorism and that the assistance that will be transferred to UNRWA is liable to reach Hamas terrorists instead of the population in Gaza. He called on all donor countries to freeze their support and demand an in-depth investigation that will cover all UNRWA employees"

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, today, visited the Bnei David Institutions in Eli, 15 graduates of which have fallen during the war.

The Prime Minister visited the memorial room where he met with fellow bereaved Israelis Eitan Moreno – the brother of Itay, Livnat Silverman – the sister of Uriel, Asaf Ben Hamo – the brother of Michael, and Yonatan Silverman – the brother of Ariel, as well as with the yeshiva rabbis, led by Rabbi Eli Sadan.

Prime Minister Netanyahu met with the students of the yeshiva and the IDF preparatory program in the study hall, where he recited the prayer for the IDF soldiers' well-being, after which Rabbi Yoel Rechel recited the prayer for the welfare of the state.

Prime Minister Netanyahu to the Bnei David students:

""Thank you Rabbi Sadan, you are a great leader of the people of Israel, and this exemplary yeshiva is to the glory of the people, heritage and fighters of Israel.

We are in the midst of a war between the sons of light and the sons of darkness. The sons of darkness, the monsters of Hamas and their partners in Hezbollah, and others, thought and said that we were weak, vulnerable, and as a spider's web – that is how they defined us. They have discovered sacrifice, heroism and great intensity, which reflects the heroism of Israel throughout our generations.

This generation is not diminishing; this generation is growing. Not only is it growing, it is storming forward with courage and an unparalleled strength of spirit. This is what is happening, with your friends, with anyone who leaves this place and with many others among the people of Israel. But this entails a heavy price, the price of the tribulations with which the Land of Israel is acquired, the loss of our best sons and fighters, many from this very study hall, which is already bereft of amazing fighters like Roi Klein, Eliraz Perez, Emmanuel Moreno and others.

We were just in the memorial room, their pictures were on the wall but the pictures are in the heart. The heavy price is not just the loss of these splendid sons, it is also the suffering of the families. I know the price of bereavement, it is too heavy to bear, but the families bear it with pride.

What I would like to say to the families, to you and to all citizens of Israel: The testament of the fallen is our mission. It is possible to summarize this mission in two words: Total victory.

This is not 'another round', neither is it an exchange of blows, nor is it an operation – it is total victory. Nothing less. I am committed to it. Our fighters are committed to it and the overwhelming majority of the people is committed to it. We will not compromise on anything less than total victory.
 
I hear talk about all kinds of deals. I would like to make it clear: We will not conclude this war without achieving all of its goals. This means eliminating Hamas, returning all of our hostages and ensuring that Gaza never again constitutes a threat to Israel.
 
We will not withdraw the IDF from the Gaza Strip and we will not release thousands of terrorists. None of this will happen. What will happen? Total victory. This victory, as it is written, will be achieved 'Not by might and not by power but by My spirit says the Lord of Hosts.' [Zechariah 4:6]. By spirit; it will be achieved by spirit.

Bialik bid us to go to the study hall. He knew this well. He was in the study hall of the Volozhin Yeshiva (https://yivoencyclopedia.org/article.aspx/Volozhin_Yeshiva_of), the mother of Lithuanian yeshivas, that my grandfather, Rabbi Natan Milikovsky-Netanyahu studied in, and where Rabbi Abraham Isaac Kook studied. A deep friendship sprung up between them. But Volozhin, with all that it contributed to the world of Torah, was in the Diaspora. And here in Eli, this study hall is planted in the soil of the motherland, where our ancestors walked, fought, planted, dreamed and built. Here – in this place. From here stems the well of generations. Here burns the flame, the flame of the promise of the eternity of Israel in the Land of Israel. This the great and noble mission. It is your mission, the mission of the fallen and it is our mission.

I salute the fallen. I salute you and tell you – together we will fight and with 
God's help, together we will win"
30.01.2024,"Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to the Soldiers and Commanders of the 43rd Battalion in Judea and Samaria: ""This sector is no less important, it is super-important. Five hundred terrorists have been eliminated here, and we are not finished, including in Jenin today.""

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, today, met with reserve soldiers and commanders of the IDF Judea and Samaria Division, 43rd Battalion, in the Binyamin Brigade, in the community of Eli.

Battalion Commander Lt.-Col. Idan Suissa briefed the Prime Minister on their activity in the sector and their quick reporting for duty, in the Binyamin area, on the morning of October 7.

Prime Minister Netanyahu to the fighters:

""We are in a battle in which we will not compromise over total victory. We must achieve total victory. In order to do so, we must deal with other sectors, and this sector is no less important, it is super-important. I know that you are investing in this on both defense and offense. It seems to be that since the start of the year, especially – of course – since the start of the war, 500 terrorists have been eliminated here, and we are not finished, including in Jenin today.

I would like to thank you for your effort, and I would like to tell you something else: I know, first of all, that you are carrying the burden, and I request that employers take this into consideration and not fire reservists, which would be terrible. If any of you are students, I also want you to know that I have met with the heads of the universities and I will meet with them again, so that they will ease conditions. Yours is a sacred task.

I would also like to tell you that the citizens of Israel, everyone, myself included, salute you. Continuing doing the work. Thank you very much"

29.01.2024,"Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, today, in Rahat, paid a condolence call at the family home of the late IDF Sergeant First Class (Res.) Ahmad Abu Latif, who fell in battle in the Gaza Strip.

The Prime Minister heard from family members about Ahmad's special and unique personality, and his heroism. His father Tewfik told about how his son always hosted soldiers at their home and told them: This is your home, this is your homeland. Ahmad's brother Kaid said that Ahmad believed in the unity of the people and its shared destiny, and that the current war had underscored this, that we were all together in the campaign. Kaid suggested memorializing his late brother by awarding the Prime Minister's Prize to pioneering research in the shared existence of Jews and Arabs in Israel.

Prime Minister Netanyahu to the family:

""There is a very interesting phenomenon that the public, I always say, has very refined senses. Even though they did not know Ahmad, but only saw a picture or heard some sentence, they absorb it immediately. Because of this, the entire people of Israel came here.

All citizens of Israel are coming here. I want to tell you that this truly reflects a very deep thing that happened here. This brotherhood and this partnership, that we know that we are fighting for the home of us all, and that people have fallen. Ahmad fell for the home of us all. He said this and expressed this even while he was alive.

I mourn this loss together with you, with his wife, with little Mansura, with the grandfather, the family and the siblings. I mourn together with you, I know what it is to lose a brother; I also saw my parents in their moments of sorrow. But the people here are very united, and this is a turning point.

I think that your suggestion is very interesting. I think that it must be advanced. There is an example here, I am not just saying this – Ahmad was an example. I also see the spirit and the light that it gives, genuine light, a good soul.

I visited the Desert Reconnaissance Battalion. One of the Bedouin officers told me: 'On the way to the area adjacent to the Gaza Strip, I saw a woman who had been beheaded. It is against this that we are fighting.' That is what he said. 'Against this we are fighting.' Against this we are fighting – fighting together.

This sense of 'together' needs to be expressed now with even greater intensity. There is a great contribution – unity – to heroes like Ahmad because it affects the entire public. It penetrates through to the heart, together.

The state is a diamond. It is a diamond that will also be in time of peace – but without the monsters.

I would like to thank you all. I would like to thank you and the mother; she is in deep sorrow."
25.01.2024,"The Prime Minister met with female field observers and soldiers of the 414th Battalion, the duty of which – in routine and in war – is to locate, expose and attack the enemy by using advanced technologies. Prime Minister Netanyahu also visit the Division sports hall, which was hit in Hamas-ISIS's brutal attack on October 7.

Prime Minister Netanyahu to the soldiers [translated from Hebrew]:

""Here, in this place, on October 7, soldiers fell, the best of our sons and daughters, may G-d avenge them. Today we are planting trees in the blood and sorrow-soaked ground, living trees in their memory.

Hamas came to uproot us; we will uproot them. Hamas came to wipe us out; we will wipe them out. We will deepen our roots in our land and we will uproot our enemies. We will be here and they will not be there.

The most important thing is that we will continue to build up the communities – the moshavim and the kibbutzim. We will make them prosper, much more than previously, and we are committed to achieving total victory. Total victory mean eliminating Hamas and returning all of our hostages – we will not give in on this goal.

Therefore, on Tu B'Shvat, here, next to the Gaza Strip, I say as clearly as possible: There is no alternative to deepening our roots and there is no substitute for total victory over our enemies.

May we all have a happy holiday"
24.01.2024,"Distinguished colleagues,

'The true sons of the kindred of David that fell with their sword in their hand… There is no truth, there is no glory but them.' With these majestic words, the poet Uri Zvi Greenberg mourned our fallen soldiers, the defenders of the homeland by whose virtue we live. Today, the finest of our sons and daughters are buried in Israel's soil. On my behalf and on behalf of all the citizens of Israel, I would like to express our endless gratitude for their heroism and boundless appreciation for their sacrifice. Our hearts, my heart, is with my brothers and sisters, family members stricken by grief. I know: Your lives have changed forever. Your agony, the void in your souls, cannot be put into words.

Each of us feels this sacrifice. Yesterday, my son Avner called me, choked up, and said, 'Dad, one of the fallen soldiers was my pupil for an entire year.' One way or another, we are all connected to the fallen, know someone who knew someone, know the families. We all embrace them with tremendous love.

All of us, together – at this moment of all moments – must dig deep for more fortitude. We will continue to fight determinedly to vanquish the brutal enemy we face. We will continue to safeguard our national revival, thereby fulfilling the desire of our dear children, mighty in spirit and deed. Their last will and testament, as you read, Mr. President, cannot be clearer. They say, 'Together to victory!' May their memories be a blessing.

Members of Knesset,

Two months ago, our commanders and their soldiers took control of the Hamas 'Parliament' in Gaza, as they call it. Of course, it is not a real parliament. It is a fiction. There are no free and democratic elections in Gaza. From time to time, this regime executes people, brings them to the town square and shoots them in the back of the head. If anyone even wants to leave the war zone, they stop them and shoot them too.

There is no real parliament in Gaza. That is why the parliament of extremism and hatred being destroyed by our forces is an image of victory. It is a powerful image, a very symbolic one, in a long and difficult campaign.

Even on this sad day, in our real parliament in Jerusalem, we see another image of victory. The Knesset's anniversary is an expression of the victory of our people's revival, the victory of freedom, of democracy, of national sovereignty. Representatives of the people are here on behalf of the people, for the people – our millennia-old people, who embrace the values of progress. Every democracy, small and large, is tested during times of war. The State of Israel has experience with war and has been tested – and we will stand together and emerge victorious from this current test as well, with G-d's help.

Every day, we prove to our enemies that they made a grave mistake. They believed we would lose all that we held dear. They fooled themselves again that Israel was as weak as a spider's web. However, the complete opposite actually occurred: We were dealt a very heavy blow on October 7, but we got back up very quickly. Israeli society came together. Regular and reserve soldiers reported for duty in droves. The IDF and our security services honed their capabilities. 

This is a war for our home. It must end – and it will end – with the defeat of the aggression and evil of the new Nazis. Anyone who participated, took hostages, and raped and murdered our citizens, brought unprecedented destruction on themselves. 

Members of Knesset,

I have heard the opinion that the events of Simchat Torah brought us back to the early days of Zionism, to the antisemitic pogroms of Eastern Europe and later the eastern lands. This may be true in one respect: The intention of those who wish to destroy us has not changed over the years. It is the same hatred. The bloodlust is the same bloodlust. However, today, unlike in the past, we have a country and we have our own army. We restored to the people of Israel the defensive force that it lost over generations. We stand like a fortified wall in the face of the dark barbarism that came for us. 

We set goals for the war, and they are robust and valid: To end Hamas's rule, to return our hostages home – all our hostages – and to ensure that Gaza will never again constitute a threat to Israel. Anyone who lifts a hand against us in Gaza, anyone who lifts a hand against us anywhere, will very quickly feel our power. There is not, nor will there be, any compromise with regard to safeguarding our existence and our future for the generations to come. I would like to add: If we have indeed returned to the early days of Zionism, it is only to clarify the understanding that we must shape our fate by ourselves. 

We will hold onto our land even more strongly. We will rehabilitate our communities, the moshavim and kibbutzim in the area adjacent to the Gaza Strip. We will return the residents of the south and the north safely to their homes. We will advance more vigorously a policy of becoming stronger. A policy of strengthening and strengthening and strengthening. Mr. Speaker, it will reach the Knesset very quickly, this clear change in our policy to strengthen ourselves, to bolster the Jewish state to a strength heretofore unknown. We will fortify Israel's status as the civilized world's guard tower in the Middle East.

Already at the beginning of the war, I told the leaders of the world, 'If Israel, G-d forbid, does not win, you will be next. The danger will certainly reach you much sooner and faster than you think.' I told them, including yesterday, 'Our war is your war, and our victory is your victory.' I also said, 'Israel will never surrender to the murderous terrorism directed by Iran.' We will fight back against those who attacked us, thereby giving humanity hope – light and not darkness, good and not evil, freedom and not slavery.

I emphasize this message, my friends, also at home. A vast majority of the people believe in Israel's spirit, in Israel's resilience, in the justness of Israel's path. When faced with those who doubt this, we will respond with words from the Bible, instead of 'a small, weak voice,' a 'strong, brave voice.' Courage will win – the courage of our soldiers, the courage of our fallen heroes. The people of Israel will be victorious.

Members of Knesset,

Tomorrow is Tu B'Shvat. Even before this day became the day of the Knesset's founding, it was a time of deepening roots and planting saplings. At Kibbutz Kerem Shalom, on the Israel-Gaza border, new trees will be planted – trees of heroism. In recent years, members of the kibbutz, secular and religious, have planted a tree in every hollow created by a rocket falling within the kibbutz's borders.

They will do so again this year, despite the kibbutz's temporary relocation to a different part of the Negev. Tomorrow they will plant the saplings, the trees, to commemorate those who fell while defending their community on Simchat Torah, an expression of the victory of our life over our enemy's culture of death. This is a great victory. It will be complete and it will be absolute. 

Happy holiday to the State of Israel, to our commanders and soldiers and to the Knesset of Israel"
23.01.2024,"Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, today (Tuesday, 23 January 2024), visited the Elyakim IDF base where he met with cadets in the company commanders training course, both conscripts and reservists.

Prime Minister Netanyahu:

""My main expectation is nothing less than total victory. There is no substitute for victory. I hear in the studios, analysts and all kinds of commentators: 'It is impossible' and 'It is not necessary.' It is possible and it is necessary, neither do we have a choice. Total victory.

These monsters will be thoroughly defeated to the end. There is no substitute for victory. This is my main expectation and I hope and am certain that it is also yours.""

Prime Minister Netanyahu added:

""What is important, in my view, is your spirit. Your spirit is the spirit of the people of Israel, of the citizens of Israel.

I want you to know that I rely on you and I believe in you. I know that it is not simple to be a commander. It is not simple because suddenly you laden yourselves with responsibility – to carry out the mission and to do so in the best way possible.

But each one of you carries on your shoulders the destiny of the people of Israel and of the State of Israel. This is no exaggeration. Today each one of you understands this. I wish you much success. May you be excellent commanders.""

Prime Minister Netanyahu was briefed by Training Center Deputy Commander Col. Sharon Eltit. The Prime Minister heard about the training regimen of the company commanders course, which trains the future officers of IDF company commanders, who in two-and-a-half months will take up their posts in the training sphere and in leading the soldiers and the fighting at the front.

Prime Minister Netanyahu spoke with the course cadets and answered their questions about the progress of the fighting, and the policy regarding activity in the various sectors: South, North, and Judea and Samaria"

22.01.2024,"Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, today, at the Prime Minister's Office in Jerusalem, met with French Armed Forces Minister Sébastien Lecornu.
 
At the start of their meeting, the Prime Minister asked the French Armed Forces Minister to convey to French President Emmanuel Macron his deep gratitude for the latter's role in delivering the medicines to the hostages in Gaza. Prime Minister Netanyahu noted that Israel is still waiting for proof that the medicines have reached their destination and emphasized that the implementation of the understandings must be monitored.
 
The two sides discussed the Lebanese issue at length. The Prime Minister emphasized that the need to distance Hezbollah terrorists from the border constitutes a national goal of the State of Israel, based on the principles of UN Security Council Resolution #1701, and said that this goal can be implemented diplomatically or in other ways"
18.01.2024,"Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, this evening, at the Kirya in Tel Aviv:

""Today I received a message from Neta, the mother of the late Yinon Tamir, a soldier in the Paratroop Brigade, who fell in the battles in Gaza. She wrote to me: 'So that we know that they did not fall in vain, destroy the evil.'

Neta, I would like to tell you and all of the bereaved families: Yinon and his heroic friends did not fall in vain. We will destroy the evil of Hamas.

In the last 48 hours, our soldiers have conducted battles in Khan Yunis, in which they eliminated dozens of terrorists. In the northern Gaza Strip, our soldiers have destroyed rocket launchers and eliminated dozens of additional terrorists. Also, in recent days, we have destroyed a major rocket production facility, and it is not the only one. Contrary to what is being said, the war is continuing on all fronts, and it will continue on all fronts – until all of the goals that we set are achieved.

This is my directive. This is the political leadership's directive to the military leadership. This is the directive of the Government of Israel to the IDF and all of the security services, and they are carrying out – and will carry out – their assignment.

To this end, we passed an immense war budget, which will enable the military and the security services to meet the goals of the war and achieve victory. Now I say this simply and with candor: Victory will yet take many long months, but we are determined to achieve it. And there is another 'but', a very difficult 'but': While our soldiers are giving their lives in order to complete the victory over Hamas, I hear other voices which are trying to weaken them. There are those in the studios who claim: 'Victory is impossible'. I utterly reject this.

Israel under my leadership will not compromise on less than total victory over Hamas, and we will win. I say this again, so that no one will be in doubt: We are striving for total victory, not just 'to strike Hamas' or 'to hurt Hamas', not 'another round with Hamas' but total victory over Hamas.

We will continue to fight will full force until we achieve all of our goals: Returning our hostages, and I say – only continued military pressure will lead to their release, eliminating Hamas and ensuring that Gaza never again constitutes a threat to Israel, that there will be no element in it that educates for terrorism, finances terrorism and sends terrorists against us.

Halting the war before our goals are achieved will harm Israel's security for generations. I tell you, citizens of Israel, we are not working just to ensure our security today – we are working to ensure our security for generations. Halting the war before the goals are achieved will broadcast a message of weakness and encourage our enemies to think that they can defeat us, and then the next massacre will be only a matter of time; therefore, we will not compromise on less than total victory.

Total victory requires eliminating the terrorist leaders and destroying Hamas's military and governing capabilities. Total victory requires returning our hostages home. Total victory requires that Gaza be demilitarized, under Israel's full security control, with Israeli control over everything that enters Gaza. These are also the fundamental conditions for 'the day after'. But I would like to emphasize: 'The day after' is the day after the elimination of Hamas, and therefore victory comes first of all. It will be achieved only if we stay focused on achieving victory, and on staying united behind our heroic soldiers who are giving their lives to achieve it.

We will yet have difficulties and challenges along the way, but after the terrible massacre of October 7, we have no other choice. This is a victory that we must achieve for the security of Israel, for our future and for true peace in our region.

I promise here before our soldiers, I promise before the bereaved families who have lost what is dearer to them than anything, and I promise before the families of the hostages – we will not stop. We will not finish the war before returning our loved ones home; we will not finish the war before total victory.

Together we will fight, and with God's help – together we will win"

While this has implications for you, we are in a major fight to restore security. 
 
The test for the restoration of security is that residents will return to their homes. We are working on this with every possible tool, on all channels: Military, diplomatic – I will not go into detail. This is another fight. At the same time, we are also looking at you. Yesterday, we passed a major package for the reservists, but note that it also has a package for the self-employed. We provided resources in yesterday's Government decision so that the money will flow immediately, because we are very concerned lest businesses be hurt. 
 
At the moment, the assistance that you are receiving is yours by right, simply by right, because you have no part in what happened. You are not responsible for it; the state is. Accordingly, we will do whatever is possible to help you"

769th Brigade Commander Col. Avraham Marciano briefed the Prime Minister on the operations of the 92nd Division over the past three months in the north. The Prime Minister also held a dialogue with conscript and reserve battalion and company commanders, who reported to the front line on October 7 and have been carrying out a defensive mission, have thwarted dozens of terrorist cells and have attacked infrastructure of the Hezbollah terrorist organization.

Prime Minister Netanyahu also visited the 769th Brigade command center where he was briefed on the situation and observed the functioning of the command center in wartime.

The Prime Minister and the Economy Minister also met with a group of soldiers from the Devora Unit, who are living in the north, but whose families have been evacuated, and heard from them about the need for security and stability in the sector in order for the residents to be able to return to their homes.

Prime Minister Netanyahu to the soldiers [translated from Hebrew]:

""I chose to come to Kiryat Shemona on a day when we are being fired on with anti-tank rockets. I greatly appreciate the service that you and your friends are doing here to defend our northern border and also to send a message to Hezbollah.

Hezbollah made a big mistake with us in 2006 and it is also doing so now. It thought that we were like 'spider's cobwebs'. Suddenly it sees what kind of 'spider'. It sees great force here, the unity of the people, the determination to do everything necessary to restore security to the north. I tell you – this is my policy.

We will do everything to restore security to the north and allow your families –because many of you are from here – to return home in safety and to know that we are not to be trifled with. We will do whatever is necessary. Of course, we prefer that this be done without a wide-ranging campaign, but that will not stop us.

We have given it an example of what is happening to its friends in the south; this is what will happen here in the north. We will do everything to restore security"
04.01.2024,"Thank you. Senator Graham, Lindsey, I appreciate your personal support and the bipartisan support of the American people, represented by the administration, by both sides of Congress.
 
We're absolutely committed to achieving our war goals, that is destroying Hamas, releasing our hostages, making sure Gaza doesn't become a threat again, and also making sure that we can return our citizens in the north and in the south. For that we'll apply maximum power with maximum precision everywhere that's needed. I'm more dedicated now to bringing stability to your country and this region, because I think Iran's goal is to destroy your efforts to reconcile with the Arab world. It's a nightmare for the ayatollah. It's an absolutely essential ingredient to a better more stable Mid-East and a safe and secure Israel and a prosperous Palestinian people.

I promise you, they will not have died in vain. We're going to do everything we can, on my end and I think working with the Biden administration, Mr. Prime Minister, to push forward to make Iran's worst nightmare real: The Arabs and the Israelis move toward the light.""

25.12.2023,"Dear Families,
Mr. Speaker,
Government ministers,
Members of Knesset,

During my years as Prime Minister, I met with representatives of all the major powers and their ambassadors in Israel, including ambassadors of China, but I don't remember inviting the Chinese ambassador to a meeting; usually they invite themselves. Several days ago, I invited him to come and asked him to convey a message directly to the president of China, Xi Jinping. The message was regarding a young, Israeli woman, Noa Argamani, a student who is supposed to start her third year at Ben-Gurion University. Noa was taken hostage at that same event you are all familiar with, together with her boyfriend. I met her mother, Leora, several times. She came with her husband Ya'akov. Leora was born in China.

I told the ambassador that I was asking him to please tell Xi Jinping, outside of protocol, outside the rules, which I know very well, that this is the daughter of a Chinese mother and that I am asking for his personal intervention with regard to Noa Argamani, because her mother is begging not only for Noa's life, but also for her own life, as she has advanced stage cancer. She told me what she said many times: 'I only ask to see my Noa once more in the time I have left.' The ambassador got back to me and said that this request had reached the President of China.

There is another head of state I approached—I had not spoken with him for many long months—and that is the president of Russia, Vladimir Putin. I spoke with him just days ago, and I told him that I was asking for him to intervene in the matter of the hostages, including Andrey Kozlov, Alex Lobanov and Alexander Trupanob. He said he would try to act in this regard. The next day, Russia's deputy foreign minister called for the immediate unconditional release of all the hostages.

I tell you all this to make one thing clear: We, my colleagues and I, are making every effort, both seen and unseen, to bring our hostages home.

Several days ago, I met with the president of the Red Cross. It was at my office in Tel Aviv, and I placed a box of medicines of the table, medicines that a considerable number of the hostages, whose pictures are presented, here need. Some are even life-saving medications. I told her, 'Take this box, pass it along. Give it to the Hamas operatives in Rafah. This is what I ask and demand of them.' She did not agree, and it was a difficult conversation.

Yesterday, my wife, Sara, sent a letter to the Pope, and she asked for his involvement on the matter of all the hostages. She asked him to approach the president of the Red Cross to ask that they visit our hostages and transfer their medicines.

We are making every effort. I won't go into all my conversations with President Biden, French President Macron, the Prime Minister of Britain and with leaders from around the world. I also won't describe the efforts we are making even as we speak, which I don't think should be detailed. I want to simply emphasize: We will shake every tree and turn over every rock to bring all our hostages home. I say this not only as part of a collective, but on an individual basis, because each and every one of them, like you, like me, is precious. 

Since the beginning of the war, I met with the families of the hostages, together with the members of the War Cabinet and on my own, including in the past several days. I hear your personal stories. I listened to Sharon Sharabi, who told me and my wife about his brother Yossi, who was taken hostage at Kibbutz Be'eri, while his wife, Nira, was able to save their daughters and seven other citizens. His brother Eli, who was taken hostage, lives near him in Kibbutz Be'eri.

We also met with Ali Ziyadne, who was elated after the release of two of his cousins, Aisha and Bilal, but this joy was mixed with worry and sadness over the condition of his brother Youssef and his brother Hamza, who are still being held by Hamas. We looked each other in the eyes at these meetings. We spoke honestly and openly, heart to heart, from a grieving heart to a burning heart. Because I look at every picture, and this is not just lip service and you all know it. 

What my colleagues said here today is true. This brings the nation together, and what unites us is that this is a sacred mission. So I say again: We will continue to make every effort to bring them home.

I want to tell you, members of Knesset and dear families, we would not have succeeded in freeing more than 100 hostages thus far without military pressure. All the pressures that we are applying, diplomatic, intelligence and others, would not succeed without military pressure. We will not be able to release all the hostages without military pressure, operational pressure, diplomatic pressure. And therefore there is one thing we will not do—we will not stop fighting.

I came here directly from Gaza. Just an hour ago, I was in the Salatin neighborhood, which abuts Jabaliya and Beit Lahiya. There, in the dust and the mud and among the ruins, I met the heroic and determined fighters of the Bahad 1 reserves brigade. You should hear them. I spoke with Brigade Commander Yehuda, who commands the reserves brigade. I asked him what they most needed. He told me that there are battles all the time and that they killed terrorists, and that unfortunately they lost several of their brothers-in-arms, but that they keep fighting. They kill terrorists all the time, day in and day out, even on an hourly basis. I asked him, 'What do you need the most?' And he answered, 'Time. We need time.'

We need to keep going until the end. I spoke with Uri, a battalion commander in the reserves. He is a father of eight children. Five of his family members are fighting in Gaza. He told me, 'We need to keep going until the end.' He hasn't been home in two months. He told me, 'My wife is at home and tells me to take two more months. Take however long it takes. To the end.'

I heard similar statements from the family members of our brave fallen soldiers. You should hear them. They speak with broken hearts and with tears in their eyes, but I must tell you, with their heads held high. They weep and I embrace them, and they stand with their heads held high. From the depths of their grief, they cry out, 'Our children did not die in vain. We cannot stop the war until we ensure total victory over those who seek to kill us.'

To you, IDF soldiers, and to you, hurting families and relatives of the hostages, and from this podium, I say: We are not stopping and we will not stop until we are victorious, because we have no country but this one, and we have no other way. Together with you, together with every home in Israel and every citizen of Israel, I pray for the well-being of our hostages, our brothers and sisters: 'Our brothers, the entire family of Israel, who are delivered into distress and captivity, whether they are on sea or dry land – may God have mercy on them and remove them from stress to relief, from darkness to light, from subjugation to redemption now, speedily and soon.'

I would like to add another prayer, a prayer for the well-being of our IDF soldiers: ""He Who blessed our forefathers Abraham, Isaac and Jacob — may He bless the soldiers of the Israel Defense Forces, who stand guard over our land and the cities of our G-d, from the border of the Lebanon to the desert of Egypt, and from the Great Sea unto the approach of the Aravah, on the land, in the air, and on the sea. May the Almighty cause the enemies who rise up against us to be struck down before them. May the Holy One, Blessed is He, preserve and rescue our soldiers from every trouble and distress and from every plague and illness, and may He send blessing and success in their every endeavor.""

We will fight together, and with G-d's help, we will win together"
25.12.2023,"Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, today, visited the northern Gaza Strip, together with IDF Deputy Chief-of-Staff Maj.-Gen. Amir Baram.

The Prime Minister was briefed by the Commander of the 261st Brigade, Col. Yehuda Wach, the Deputy Commander of the 162nd Division and the Deputy Commander of the 261st Brigade about their activity in the northern Gaza Strip, the quantity of enemy war materiel that had been found in almost every home and the soldiers' determination to continue with full force. Prime Minister Netanyahu also heard about the many tunnel shafts that had been found in the heart of a civilian area and was briefed on the routes of the tunnels.

The Prime Minister spoke with the soldiers and heard from them about their insistence and determination regarding the mission – to fight until the end, until victory.

Prime Minister Netanyahu to the soldiers:

""I am here with you in the northern Gaza Strip and I am extraordinarily impressed. Previously, I told your commanders, and you, as reservists, as soldiers – we are proud of you and rely on you. We see the determination and the desire to continue on until the end.""

Then I have two things to tell you: First, we will do everything to maintain your safety and your lives. While we want to pursue the mission, we want to safeguard you even more. That is the first – and most important – thing.

Second, we are not stopping. Whoever talks about stopping – there is no such thing. We are not stopping. The war will continue until the end, until we finish it, no less.

I know that you left your families and that your families support you. That is amazing. That is the power – the key to victory.""

A soldier:

""We left two of our friends here.""

Prime Minister Netanyahu:

""I know. Not a few, and dear friends. For this we are continuing. The testament is to continue.""

The Prime Minister stood by them, and said that their sons did not fall in vain.

The forum representatives sought to convey a message to the members of the War Cabinet from bereaved families from across the country, that all the goals of the war must be insisted upon, and not to give in to pressure. The representatives also requested that the fighting be conducted while safeguarding the lives of our soldiers.

Prime Minister Netanyahu told the forum representatives that Israel would not stop the war until all of its goals had been completed – until victory.

Prime Minister Netanyahu at the meeting:

""There will not be another round. There is national consensus that embraces the entire people: There needs to be victory – until the goals are completed.

This is a difficult and brutal war, and you know how difficult it is. We will do everything to safeguard the soldiers' lives"
19.12.2023,"We are committed, and I am personally committed, to the release of all of the hostages. Rescuing them is the highest mission.

Just now I twice sent the Director of the Mossad to Europe to advance a process for the release of our hostages. I will spare no effort on the matter and the demand is to bring them all.""

In response to a question from one of those present, the Prime Minister said:

""Will I succeed? I can guarantee you one thing – we are not stopping.""

Sara Netanyahu said:

""Several weeks ago, I sent letters to the leaders' wives, mother-to-mother. I noted that kidnapping is a crime against humanity and I asked them to help us. I embrace you along with the entire people of Israel and I am certain that we will continue to do everything to bring your loved ones back home safely"
19.12.2023,"Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, today, visited the Sheba Medical Center Victims of War Rehabilitation Center, where he met with civilians who were wounded on October 7th and IDF soldiers who were wounded in the fighting in the Gaza Strip.

The wounded soldiers told the Prime Minister about the fierce battles they waged against Hamas terrorists. The Prime Minister was updated on their medical status, recovery process and the rehabilitation that they are now undergoing.

Prime Minister Netanyahu at the conclusion of the visit:

""Thank you to the medical team, which has performed miracles. There is a combination here of miracles and utmost heroism the likes of which I do not think have been seen anywhere. These are genuine heroes who are coming back to life.

The lives of our soldiers is our highest concern. These are the orders that we give – to safeguard their lives and do everything so that they will be able to fight and stay safe. This is what we have done and this is what we will continue to do. There is nothing more precious. You are genuine heroes.""

Sheba Medical Center Associate Director General Prof. Arnon Afek:

""Most of those wounded in the war are currently being cared for in the departments and at the Victims of War Rehabilitation Center that was established at the start of the war. We will continue to receive them and provide them with the best medical care until we return them to life"
18.12.2023,"Mr. Secretary, it's good to welcome you and your delegation again. We're fighting a war of civilization against barbarism. 

I can say that when we spoke, I expressed again our commitment, Israel's commitment, to achieve total victory against Hamas. And we think this is not only our war but in many ways your war because you are leading the forces of civilization in the world.
 
This is a battle against the Iranian axis, the Iranian axis of terror, which is now threatening to close the maritime strait of Bab el-Mandeb. This threatens the freedom of navigation of the entire world. I appreciate the fact that you're taking action to open that strait. It's not only our interest, it is the interest I think of the entire civilized community.
 
I want to thank you for the support that you have shown consistently, and I welcome the opportunity to talk about what else we're doing to have our common interests served.""

US Secretary of Defense Austin:

""Prime Minister Netanyahu, thanks for hosting us again. This is my fourth visit to Israel as Secretary of Defense and my second since the terrible day of October 7th. I'm here to underscore what President Biden has said again and again: our commitment to Israel is unshakeable. I know that Israel is a small, tightknit country and I know that all Israelis were touched by the vast evil committed by Hamas. So I'm here to mourn with you for the innocent souls taken from you on October 7th and I'm also here to stand alongside the families of those still missing in Gaza, including US citizens.
 
America's commitment to Israel is unwavering and no individual, group or state should test our resolve. So in the Red Sea, we're leading a multinational maritime taskforce to uphold the bedrock principle of freedom of navigation. Iran's support for Houthi attacks on commercial vessels must stop. Now, we'll continue to provide Israel with the equipment that you need to defend your country, Mr. Prime Minister, including critical munitions, tactical vehicles and air defense systems.

We'll continue to support Israel's mission to find and free all of the hostages. I'm also here to discuss how we can best support Israel on a path to lasting security and that means tackling urgent needs first. We must get more humanitarian assistance in to the nearly two million displaced people in Gaza and we must distribute that aid better.

We want to thank you for the recent initiatives that you've taken, Mr. Prime Minister. We applaud that and hopefully that will enable us to move even more in. Thanks for again being a great host and I look forward to a great discussion, Mr. Prime Minister"
18.12.2023,"The Israeli economy is a strong ship in stormy seas. It is strong because especially over the last 20 years, we have turned it from a mainly Government managed economy to a free economy. This is the great key to releasing the forces of creativity, innovation and entrepreneurship latent in our citizens, without which the technology could do nothing. In North Korea there is technology, also in Russia.
 
This has helped us, this free market revolution, it is what we need to continue developing constantly, to reduce bureaucracy and regulation, to facilitate entrepreneurship and success, as well as failure – this policy has given us a strong economy that has helped us weather international crises, to a large extent, better than almost any other country in the world, including our exit, almost first – if not the first – in the world from the coronavirus crisis.
 
This strength also give us the ability to meet the burdens of the war, against a brutal enemy who exacts from us a very heavy and painful cost – the fallen, their families and, of course, the challenges that we face. We are also committed to winning the war, to uprooting and eliminating Hamas, to releasing our hostages, to ensuring that no threat to the State of Israel arises from the Gaza Strip ever again, and to ensuring stability and security on the other fronts.
 
All of this is in our grasp and the economy is an important component that will also allow us to utilize the necessary resources, especially in strengthening the reserves and providing the necessary equipment, in order to achieve these goals today and also to ensuring security tomorrow.
 
In order to do this, we need a very experienced and seasoned team in charge of the right policy for the ship. Therefore, over the years I have thought that the position of Governor of the Bank of Israel is a critical position in the crew on board the ship, and two things are necessary: One, to ensure what is understood in all of the advanced world economies, that the Governor of the Bank will be truly independent and that the central bank will indeed be independent; we enacted legislation to this end. Second, to choose appropriate men and women for this position who will fulfill it with responsibility and professionalism according to the free market economic policy, without which there is no possibility of financing anything. This is not to say that you will always be in the same fiscal framework, because sometimes conditions change, you need to spend more, but you are capable of fulfilling it due to our strong economy.
 
Several years ago, when Prof. Simhon came to me and proposed the candidacy of Prof. Amir Yaron, I did not know him. But I read several articles that he wrote, both while you were at Wharton and elsewhere. I was impressed by your professionalism, your insight, and your policy, which is our policy; therefore, I thought that you were a very worthy candidate and you have proven this. This is not to say that we have not disagreed from time to time, we do so behind closed doors and in the optimal manner, but all in all there has been very great agreement, and I also think, very great success.
 
Therefore, I think that the continuity and stability that we are showing in my consultations with the Finance Minister, especially during the war, the continuity in your position broadcasts the same stability, professionalism and seriousness regarding the Israeli economy, which is essential.
 
I would like to add one more item about the economy. It is clear, maybe it is not, but I will define is as succinctly as possible, because I think that this is the greatest challenge we face beyond victory in the war. Over the years, we have increased the security budget but in practice we have reduced it as a proportion of GDP. We have done so because our free market policy has increased GDP and therefore, if the security budget has also increased as a proportion of GDP, it has declined.
 
We will be unable to continue with this policy. As of now, we must significantly increase – in absolute terms, a considerable increase – the security budget by at least NIS 20 billion per annum, also as a proportion of GDP. It is possible that the supplement will be 1% or more of GDP in order to meet our security needs.
 
We are in the midst of several very extreme caliphates that want to uproot and destroy us, and we must strengthen ourselves. This strength also gives us the ability to forge alliances within and beyond the region. This requires a very significant increase in the security budget.
 
Our ship, the ship of the Israeli economy, which is also a passenger vessel and a commercial ship, needs to arm itself with more cannon and become a very, very strong warship. This is the first thing that will ensure our ability to sail it to safe shores.
 
I am certain that with your help, in the continuation of your important work and that of our team, we will succeed in this mission as well.
 
May you have great success"
14.12.2023,"Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, today, at the Kirya in Tel Aviv, met with International Committee of the Red Cross President Mirjana Spoljaric.

At the start of the meeting, the Prime Minister described to the ICRC President the atrocities carried out by Hamas-ISIS, including the murder of children and infants, and the abuse and brutal rapes of women.

Prime Minister Netanyahu also described the inhuman conditions in which Hamas is holding the hostages and the prevention of humanitarian assistance for them.

The Prime Minister presented the ICRC President with a full package of vital medicines and demanded that the ICRC fulfill its role and deliver it to the hostages in Gaza.

Prime Minister Netanyahu to ICRC President Spoljaric:

""They’re doing something that is quite incredible. They’ve taken children, babies, women, old people, Holocaust survivors, festival participants. And after they shot hundreds, murdered over 1,200 people, they take these people and they take them as hostages. Where’s that heard of?

The only difference from our point of view is not the intent, but the capability. If they had the capability, they would have killed every last one of us. They didn’t, because we fought back, sometimes with incredible odds. People, mothers, fought with fingernails. 

There’s a difference between the deliberate and systematic murder, maiming and menacing of civilians, which is what terrorism is, and the unintended consequences, unintended casualties that accompany any warfare. This is the entire difference. 

I want to express my gratitude for your help in securing the release of the hostages, but at the same time, some of the statements that have come out from your organization seem to not make the distinction that I’ve just made.

My goal, as you know in our conversations, is to see how we can help the remaining hostages. You have every avenue, every right and every expectation to place public pressure on Hamas"

Prime Minister Netanyahu spoke by radio with the 460 Brigade Commander, Col. Dvir Edri, who is currently fighting in the heart of the Gaza Strip and told him:

""Continue on but watch out for yourselves. I am certain that you will do this.

I want you to pass along to the last soldier: We are continuing to the end, until victory, until the destruction of Hamas. Let there be no doubt about this. This is important. This is the message that I want to reach every soldier there. Be strong and have courage. Thank you.""

The 460 Brigade Commander told the Prime Minister [translated from Hebrew]:

""Sir, we want to continue. Give us the force. We are strong here. We will carry out the mission – we will destroy Hamas. We have the strength for this. We have excellent soldiers and commanders and we will continue the mission until we destroy the last of the terrorists.""

Prime Minister Netanyahu spoke to the commanders:

""I want to express deep appreciation on behalf of all citizens of Israel for your efforts in the fighting, for the sacrifice, heroism and success. However, there is a great pain that we are feeling. Yesterday we had a very difficult day and every day we have dear sons who fall. They are true heroes of Israel, my heart and our hearts are with the fallen and with the families. We know that their lives have changed.

But I want to say as clearly as possible what I have just said to the commander in the field: we are continuing until the end. There is no question whatsoever about this. I also say this in light of the great pain, but also in the face of the international pressures. Nothing will stop us. We are going on to the end, until victory, nothing less. I thank you. We are doing this thanks to you, through you, and with G-d's help and yours.

This war will continue but it is important that it continue with the sophistication that you bring. This sophistication saves many lives and gives us very great leverage. Thank you very much"

""The contribution of the men and women of the Israel Police in stopping the criminal invasion by those murderers was decisive. You had an immense role in the blocking action, and today the entire people of Israel knows it. Today the entire nation is united, first of all, in the pain of our fallen citizens, police officers IDF soldiers and ISA personnel. The heart grieves.
 
We are celebrating the festival of Chanukah and you know that four of the five Hasmoneans fell to the enemy. But like you, they did not give up and fought to the end against a brutal enemy that wanted to wipe the Jewish people off the face of the earth – our heritage, our faith, our religion, our people; they came to wipe us off the face of the earth.
 
The Maccabees then fought, they did not give in, and won. And the Maccabees of today are you: You are not giving up, you are continuing to victory. There is no compromise. It is total victory. Merely winning is insufficient because we will also free all of our hostages. I am insisting that there will be no force that educates for terrorism, pays for terrorism and supports terrorism. It will not be. I have said this and I reiterate: Neither Hamastan nor Fatahstan. Not the one and not the other. We will insist on this together.
 
We are united. We are a united force. With G-d's help, and yours, we will win.

12.12.2023,"Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, together with Prime Minister's Office (PMO) Director General Yossi Shelley, lit Chanukah candles with PMO employees, at the PMO in Jerusalem.

Prime Minister Netanyahu wished the employees a happy Chanukah and said:

""I know that this joy is mixed with sadness. Behind us here, are photos of four sons of PMO employees who fell in our very just and vital war, and we are celebrating Chanukah today. Four sons of the Maccabees, the sons of the Hasmoneans, fell in battle with the enemy. We know that we are in the same fight for the continued existence of the Jewish people, for the thread of our existence.

I would like to thank each and every one of you for the important work that you are doing at this time in order to ensure the continuation of the eternal Israel. Just as we did in those days, so we are doing at this time.

May you all have a happy holiday."""
11.12.2023,"Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his wife Sara, today paid a condolence visit to the family of Col. Asaf Hamami, the commander of the Southern Brigade in Gaza, who fell on October 7th.
 
Prime Minister Netanyahu told the family [translated from Hebrew]:
 
""We mourn together with your wonderful family over the sacrifice and heroism of the exalted Asaf, a hero of Israel and example to his people. We will remember him forever and we will always tell his story like a candle for future generations.""
 
Sara Netanyahu told the family [translated from Hebrew]:
 
""There are no words to describe the magnitude of the loss. Asaf was a symbol and example for all of us, the Jewish people and all citizens of the world. He will always be in the pages of the history of the heroism of the people of Israel. May you know no more sorrow"
08.12.2023,"We are here by the remnant of our Temple from 2,000 years ago. The Maccabees of that time liberated the Temple, purified it, re-established Jewish sovereignty and independence, and saved the heritage, religion and people of Israel. Without them the thread of our lives would been torn and we would not be standing here today.

The battle then was against the forces of evil who came to wipe the Jewish people off the face of the Earth. Today we – the Maccabees of our times – are fighting the forces of evil that have come to wipe the Jewish people and its state off the face of the earth. We are showing the same determination, heroism and sacrifice.

This evening we embrace with a grieving heart our friend Gadi Eisenkot and his wife Hannah, who lost their young son Gal whom I saw and spoke with some years ago. These are the sons of all of us, as it is with the other fallen – the sons and daughters of all of us. I have heard the stories of the heroism of our soldiers, of our men and women police officers whom I have met and sometimes fought with their fingernails, the accounts of utmost heroism, who repelled the enemy.

We are currently deep inside the Gaza Strip. This enemy will not break us up – we will break it up. This enemy will not wipe us out, we will wipe it out. This enemy will not overcome us, we will overcome it. This is being carried out day by day and night by night, and we will do it until the end. I believe with complete faith in the inherent power of this people, the power of life. But this power of life requires us, sometimes, to endure the tribulations of bereavement. Apparently, this is the price of our existence in our land, but we can bear it.

I would like to thank you, men and women of the Israel Police, for what you are doing day and night for the security of our country, and for the future of our people. I offer you heartfelt thanks. I think that the entire nation has learned to recognize your unique contribution. I believe that the joined forces of all parts of our people and all of our citizens, we will quickly bring the absolute victory over the forces of evil and restore security not only to the south but to the north as well, from where I have just returned.

I spoke with President Biden this evening and I told him: 'We are on the eve of Chanukah.' He told me that he had a menorah in his office. I told him: 'We have a menorah in our heart, for our country and our future.'

This year we are lighting the first Chanukah candle in the knowledge that this light will never be extinguished. Even if this holiday is diluted with sorrow, may we – knowing this – have a happy holiday. A happy holiday to you"
07.12.2023,"Prime Minister Netanyahu: ""If Hezbollah decides to open an all-out war, then with its own hands it will turn Beirut and southern Lebanon, which are not far from here, into Gaza and Khan Yunis."" 

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Defense Minister Yoav Gallant and IDF Chief-of-Staff Lt.-Gen. Herzi Halevi, today, held an assessment at IDF Northern Command Headquarters. Head of Northern Command Maj.-Gen. Ori Gordin, senior Northern Command staff officers and division commanders also participated. Participants reviewed the activity of IDF forces in the northern sector as well as the area intelligence assessment.

The Prime Minister, along with Maj.-Gen. Gordin, then visited an artillery battery in the Upper Galilee, where he spoke with reserve infantry and artillery soldiers, who have been serving on the forward line along the Lebanese border for the past two months.

Prime Minister Netanyahu heard about the soldiers' activity in the area and their readiness to continue ensuring the security of the country.

Prime Minister Netanyahu at the artillery battery in the Upper Galilee:

""I am here with reservists who are showing great spirit in their readiness for battle, to complete the job, to restore security, not only in the south but also in the north. This is our commitment.

This evening we light Chanukah candles. In times of combat, this candle shines light, also out of grief for our heroic sons and daughters who have fallen, for our hostages whom we have not yet returned but whom we will return, for the wounded who are suffering and for the civilians who have also fallen in heroic battles.

But I am impressed by the great spirit here. You have expressed it and I want you to know that this obligates us. The people are proud of you.

I also suggest that our enemies pay attention to this spirit because if Hezbollah decides to open an all-out war, then with its own hands it will turn Beirut and southern Lebanon, which are not far from here, into Gaza and Khan Yunis. We are determined to achieve victory and we will do so with your help"
06.12.2023,"Citizens of Israel, good evening.
 
This week we will light the first candle of Chanukah. Our soldiers will bring light to the darkness, in the alleyways of Gaza, in the ruins of Sajaiya, in the terrorist lairs in Khan Yunis. The lights together, as a great light, will cleave the darkness.
 
Our soldiers are the heirs of the Maccabees. Today, as then, they are fighting with bravery, utmost heroism and determination. And today, like then, we will pray together for their well-being. We will pray together for peace in our land: 'To Your people Israel, you worked a great salvation.'
 
Citizens of Israel, today, I and my colleagues in the War Cabinet met with the families of the hostages – those whom we have already succeeded in returning home and those for whom we are doing everything to return. I heard heartbreaking stories. I heard about thirst, about hunger, about mental and physical abuse, about young children who are still whispering out of fear, about the great darkness in which their loved ones are being held.
 
I heard, as you have, about the sexual abuse and rapes of unparalleled brutality. But I must say that up until a few days ago, I did not hear the human rights organizations. I did not hear the women's organizations. I did not hear the UN. I did not hear them crying out. And I say to them: 'Where are you? You are being silent because they are Jewish women?' I want to say this in a language that everyone understands:
 
[English]
 
I say to the women's rights organizations, to the human rights organizations, you've heard of the rape of Israeli women, horrible atrocities, sexual mutilation.
 
Where the hell are you? I expect all civilized leaders, governments, nations, to speak up against this atrocity.
 
[End English]
 
I fully share the deep concern of the families whose loved ones are still being held in Gaza. I understand the uncertainty. I understand the unbearable difficulty. I told the families that we will spare no effort to return their loved ones. Bringing all of our hostages home is one of the three main goals that we determined for the war, and these goals reinforce each other.
 
We check every piece of information. I want you to know that there is a vast intelligence effort dealing only with this, around the clock. We are working prudently and responsibly. We are working to bring all of our hostages home safely. And I say all of them – male and female soldiers, male and female civilians, young and old, everyone, without exception. In every decision, the return of the hostages stands before our eyes, and we are on the right path.
 
Today I saw little Emilia Aloni, six years old, returning to kindergarten. The teacher hugged her. Her friends hugged her. For one moment in these dark days, the heart filled with joy – and these days this is something. We succeeded in returning home 110 hostages by a combination of a ground incursion of unprecedented strength and a continuous diplomatic effort. And I tell you – this is the only way to also return the hostages who are still in Hamas captivity, and we are committed to doing so.
 
Hamas tried to break us up – we will break it up. Many of the murderers were from the Sajaiya Battalion, they broke through the fence, went to nearby communities and perpetrated these atrocities. Therefore, at the start of the week, we eliminated the commander of the Sajaiya Battalion, who oversaw many of the horrific acts on October 7th as well as many other acts of murder. As of now, we have eliminated around half of Hamas's battalion commanders. We are settling accounts with all those who abducted, with all those who were involved, and with all those who murdered, massacred, raped and burned the daughters and sons of our people. We will neither forgive nor forget.
 
We have ordered the IDF to continue the war. Our soldiers are expanding the ground operation against Hamas throughout the Gaza Strip, including in the southern Gaza Strip. Tonight we operated there with great force. The ground shook in Khan Yunis and Jebalya. We have encircled them both. There is no place we cannot reach. We took control of the base of Hamas General Security. Our brave soldiers are fighting the murderers with great force. They are conducting face-to-face battles. They are eliminating many terrorists around the clock. In every battle, in every battle, we have the upper hand. We are fighting until the end, until absolute victory.
 
Our fighting men and women are the embodiment of the resilience and determination of the entire nation. But all of this has an unbearable price. Every loss is heart-rending. Ben Sussman fell this week in the battles in Gaza. Ben was a soldier in the combat engineers. Ben was a hero of Israel, the salt of the earth, an outstanding athlete. He was a soldier with every fiber of his being. Four friends from his school – Himmelfarb High School in Jerusalem – fell together with Ben. We also lost Aner Shapira, a _Nahal_ Brigade soldier who saved the lives of many at Reim after he threw back seven grenades. To our sorrow, we also lost his comrades Ariel Reich, an armored corps officer, Shachar Friedman, a paratrooper, and Dvir Barzani, also a paratrooper.
 
This evening I say to the families of Ben, Aner, Ariel, Shachar and Dvir, and I tell the dear families of every one of our fallen heroes: Your loved ones, our loved ones, did not fall in vain. We will fight together, we will be victorious, we will destroy Hamas.
 
We will fight until victory, until we achieve all of our goals: Returning all of the hostages, eliminating Hamas and ensuring that Gaza never again constitutes a threat to Israel. We will ensure that there will be no element there that supports terrorism, educates for terrorism, and finances terrorism and the terrorists' families.
 
I want to say an additional word about 'the day after Hamas': Gaza must be demilitarized. And in order for Gaza to be demilitarized, there is only one force that can see to this demilitarization – and that force is the IDF. No international force can be responsible for this. We have seen what has happened in other places where they brought in international forces for the goal of demilitarization. I am not prepared to close my eyes and accept any other arrangement. I again call on the civilian population in Gaza to leave the areas in which we are fighting Hamas.
 
I say here to our friends in the world who are pressing for a quick end to the war: Our only way to end the war, and end it quickly, is to apply crushing pressure against Hamas – and destroy it. If our friends want to help shorten the war, which is also their war against the barbarism that threatens to engulf the world, they simply need to stand steadfast alongside us.
 
And I say to them in English and in every language:
 
[English]
 
Stand with us. 
 
Stand with Israel.
 
Stand with civilization!

Citizens of Israel, on my many visits in the field, I meet our heroic fighting men and women from the IDF, the ISA and the police. One of the soldiers, named Ariel, from the armored corps, spoke to me from atop his tank inside Gaza. In his tank, as in others in the field, are religious and secular, Jews and non-Jews, right-wingers and left-wingers. They are all fighting together. They are all imbued with a great spirit – of unity, comradeship and victory.

01.12.2023,"Citizens of Israel,

This evening we received difficult news. It finally became clear that Col. Asaf Hamami, a hero of Israel, fell in battle on the 7th of October. Asaf was the commander of the Gaza Division Southern Brigade. Two weeks ago I met with his family. We prayed together for a different result, which to my regret, did not materialize. Asaf was a hero for all of us. May his memory be blessed.

Citizens of Israel,

'Whoever saves one life, it is as if he has saved the entire world.' Last week we rescued many worlds. We returned 110 souls to Israel. We freed 86 Israeli citizens – children, women, young people, mothers and grandmothers, as well as dozens of foreign nationals. The entire nation and many around the world held their breath as they followed each release.

The boys and girls and young people whom we returned home: Raz, Aviv, Hila, Alma, Noam, Emma, Yuli, Emilia, Avigail, Emily, Gali, Amit, Eitan, Nava, Yahel, Noam, Ohad, Uriah, Yuval, Ofri, Erez, Mia, Noga, Ofir, Dafna, Ela, Tal, Agam, Gal, Or, Yagil, Itay, Maya, Bilal, Aisha, Uri, Natali, Mika, Liam – and many others whom we have released.

These are not just names but souls of boys and girls that we brought back home, we brought them back to life. We will be with them and look after them. I embrace them on behalf of all of you, citizens of Israel: Welcome to those who have left the horrors, welcome back home.

The Psalmist writes (142:8): 'Take my soul out of confinement'. We have taken them out of confinement, from darkness to light, from slavery to redemption.

Only one week ago this seemed unbelievable, completely imaginary. And today they are here, wrapped in the love of their families and of the people. How great is the joy of their return, and how great is the pain of those who were murdered amidst terrible brutality and of those who have not yet returned.

I deliberated greatly before the decision. I asked myself how does one negotiate with the Satan who murdered, raped, dismembered and burned human beings, women, children and infants, a Satan to whom human life has no value.

But at the same time, it was clear to me that we could find a way to rescue dozens of hostages from the Satan's claws. I was not prepared to give up on that possibility.

We conducted tough negotiations under fire, from evening to morning and from morning to evening. I spoke frequently with President Biden and we pressed the intermediaries in order to improve the outline. And indeed, we succeeded in considerably improving it.

We applied pressure around the world – the Mossad, the negotiating team, the ISA and the IDF. I was in continuous and daily contact with the White House. The efforts were productive; we doubled the number of those who were released but the mission has yet to be completed.

This week I visited our wounded at Soroka Medical Center. I met there with heroic fighters and another hero, Mia Regev. Mia was abducted by Hamas murderers from the party at Reim. They shot her and wounded her leg. She endured physical and mental tribulations but she is recovering. She is strong. Mia met her brother Itay, who was also abducted and whom we also succeeded in freeing. I stood by her bed. I embraced her. I embraced her father Ilan and her younger brother Guy. What can I tell you citizens of Israel, my brothers and sisters, I saw with my own eyes a family that was reborn.

We achieved the releases of our hostages thanks to a combination of the massive military pressure by our heroic soldiers and the relentless diplomatic effort I led along with my colleagues.

My wife Sara and I met again this week with parents of several of our hostages who remain in the terrible Hamas captivity. We embraced them and I promised them: We will do everything to bring them back home – all of them.

In order to complete the sacred mission of returning all of our hostages, in order to eliminate Hamas, and in order to ensure that Gaza does not go back to constituting a threat to Israel, and that there will be no element there that educates its children for terrorism, supports terrorism finances terrorism and calls for the destruction of Israel – we are continuing to fight with full force. Our soldiers prepared for this during the pause – for absolute victory over Hamas.

I met in the field with our fighting men and women who told me: 'Mr. Prime Minister, continue until the end' and I told them: 'To the end – of that there is no question.'

Citizens of Israel, I tell you this evening that you have those whom you can rely on. The fighting men and women of the IDF, the ISA, the policemen and women who have fought with utmost heroism – they are the best. They have great spirit, strength and faith. They nobly and heroically bear the pain of losing their heroic comrades and commanders who have fallen, and thus our entire people – until victory is achieved.

The fighting continues.

The day before yesterday I directed the IDF, together with the War Cabinet, to resume fighting, with increasing force. In the last 24 hours, we have destroyed over 400 Hamas terrorist targets. We carried out extensive aerial attacks in Khan Yunis. We eliminated terrorists and infrastructure in Beit Lahiya. We are continuing to act in the northern Gaza Strip.

Last week, many of you asked what one of our heroic soldiers whom I visited inside the Gaza Strip asked me: 'Will the fighting resume after the days of the pause?' I answered him: 'Unequivocally – yes!' Now the answer is clear to everyone.

I state clearly and unequivocally: We will continue the war until we achieve all of its goals and it is impossible to achieve these goals without continuing the ground incursion. The ground incursion was essential in order to bring about the results up to now, and it is necessary to bring about future results.

I tell our friends around the world, you share our goal of eliminating Hamas and releasing our hostages; therefore, I also emphasize to them that there is no way of achieving these goals except by victory, and there is no way to achieve victory except by continuing the ground incursion. The IDF and the security forces are doing this with determination, strength and while upholding international law.

In the north as well, we are taking continuous action against Hezbollah's efforts to act against us. We are thwarting terrorist cells, pushing the enemy away from our border and destroying war materiel.

We are continuing with the policy that we have determined: Strong deterrence in the north, clear decision in the south.

We are not sitting idly by in the face of the aggression against us. We are returning fire many times over. Let it be clear: We are committed to restoring security both in the south and the north. If Hezbollah makes a mistake and enters into a broad war, it will be destroying Lebanon with its own hands.

Citizens of Israel, we are in the midst of a difficult and bitter war but there is no war more just. It is a war for our home. All of us are united behind the justice of our cause and all of us give full backing to our soldiers. A difficult war is yet before us, but in the end, we will be victorious.

Together we will fight – and with God's help, together we will win"
30.11.2023,"Sara Netanyahu, today, toured the communities of the area adjacent to the Gaza Strip. At Kibbutz Reim, she was briefed by the commander of the Netivot police station, police officers and Border Police officers who fought on Saturday of October 7th, and heard their many stories of heroism.

She then toured the area where Hamas murderers perpetrated a massacre at the party near Kibbutz Reim and acknowledged the pain at the memorial that has been established at the area of the Nova party, where she met with and embraced families who lost loved ones, and listened to the stories of the civilians who succeeded in escaping the horrors.

Tekuma Authority Director Moshe Edri presented Prime Minister Netanyahu with the plan for rebuilding the communities in the area adjacent to the Gaza Strip and thanked him for fully backing the work of the Authority, which was established at his direction.

The Prime Minister heard about residents' various needs and the existing responses. He said that the State of Israel is committed to settlement in the area adjacent to the Gaza Strip, to rebuilding the kibbutzim that were attacked and to restoring security.

The council heads thanked the Prime Minister for visiting and commended him for his efforts to return all of the hostages and for his goal of bringing about a decisive victory over Hamas.

Prime Minister Netanyahu to the council heads:

""On the first day, we declared that this was a war, not an operation or another round, but a war. This war has several goals. The first goal is the elimination of Hamas. The second goal is returning all of our hostages. The third goal is to ensure that after Hamas is eliminated, the Gaza Strip does not go back to being a threat to the State of Israel, to any part of the State of Israel.

We will not spare investments. I hear both the little things and the big things. There is a battle here with the bureaucracy and I am fighting it. I hear your cry. The Government ministries are working hard but there is much to improve. We will not rest just with rebuilding. We need to establish new communities"
30.11.2023,"Welcome.

The Secretary and I had an opportunity to begin to discuss the many issues that we want to talk about.

But first, I want to express our appreciation for your support from the beginning: the President, you personally, the delegation, in the war of eliminating Hamas and releasing, securing the release of our hostages. You've been very, very helpful. We appreciate it deeply.

The people of Israel hold onto our land by the fingernails, repelled the murderers, the monsters, and now we are in the midst of action that will continue to its end. 
 
We established a state, an army, communities and cities. We welcomed immigrants, but the battle continues as it has for 100 years and more. It most definitely continued here on that terrible day and we will overcome them. 
 
This construction expresses what we are now doing. Several months ago, we decided to establish a new community and called it 'Hanun' and today we are changing its name to 'Ofir' after the late Ofir Leibstein, a leader, a man of the Land of Israel, a builder and a man engaged in settling the land. Here children will grow up and be educated about his contribution, heroism and sacrifice. 
 
We will continue to build, not one community but communities, here in this place. We will build and we will continue to build, here and all throughout the Land of Israel. We will rebuild and expand the communities, and we will add more communities.""

Rafi Milo, the Prime Minister's Chief of Staff Tzachi Braverman, the Prime Minister's Military Secretary, Maj.-Gen. Avi Gil, and Prime Minister's Office Director General Yossi Shelley. 
 
The cornerstone-laying for the community of Ofir is a direct continuation of the Government decision, by the Prime Minister and the Construction and Housing Minister on 5 February 2023, to establish a new community in the area adjacent to the Gaza Strip to be called Hanun (which was defined as a provisional name"

""I am here with the National Security Minister, the Inspector General, and Amir and the heroic fighters who conducted an exemplary battle here in which they lost comrades. The police [station] behind us was demolished and we are building a new one, but this attests to what happened here. I heard the stories, the resourcefulness and the courage and mutual responsibility which is simply an example for the State of Israel. On behalf of the entire people of Israel and all citizens of Israel, I salute you; you are genuine heroes. Well done.
 
The people of Israel owe you a great debt. We appreciate the work of the police, and their sacrifice, and that of the Border Police. You fought as both individuals and groups in the worst possible conditions, and proved yourselves. On the day of the highest test, you met the challenge in an exemplary manner, and I truly say to you with all my heart, and that of the entire people, all citizens of Israel – you are heroes. Thank you very much"

I am here to tell the soldiers, who all tell me the same thing, and I repeat it to you, citizens of Israel: We are continuing until the end – until victory. Nothing will stop us, and we are convinced that we have the force, the strength, the will and the determination to achieve all of our goals for the war, and this is what we will do.

I sat with the IDF Deputy Chief of Staff and the commanders. On the wall it was written: 'Am Israel Chai' [The People of Israel Live]. Then Am Yisrael Chai and the people of Israel will also win thanks to you. Thank you"

24.11.2023,"Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, met with ZAKA  President Eyal Mashiach, ZAKA CEO Dubi Weissenstern and ZAKA commanders and volunteers. 

The Prime Minister heard from the ZAKA members – who come from all sections of Israeli society: Jews, Arabs, religious and secular – powerful testimony about their work locating and identifying the bodies of those who were murdered in the communities adjacent to the Gaza Strip, which was carried out under fire. The ZAKA members described the horrific acts perpetrated by Hamas on October 7th: Tying up family members and setting them on fire, murdering small children, verifying kills, brutally raping women and more. 

Prime Minister Netanyahu also heard from ZAKA volunteers about their public diplomacy activity in Israel and the world, and about their deep sense of mission in carrying out their sacred tasks. 

Prime Minister Netanyahu [translated from Hebrew]: 
""You have given direct testimony of the most terrible horrors that have been perpetrated against the Jewish people since the Holocaust. The only difference between what happened in the Holocaust and what happened in the area adjacent to the Gaza Strip is the ability; if they could have, they would have slaughtered us all. 

I visited the Bedouin Desert Patrol Unit in which Arabs and Jews, Muslims and Christians, fight shoulder-to-shoulder. The Bedouin officer told me that like you he went there: 'The first thing that I saw on the way to the highway was the decapitated body of a woman, and I understand who we were facing.' You saw the whole range of these horrors. First of all, I want to thank you for the strength of spirit to see such things and yet continue. I hope that you are taking care of yourselves; that is also important. Of course, you are also doing this sacred work and when you talk among yourselves and to the outside world, you must speak out. These are powerful stories and we are in a major fight. 

This fight is not about to end at the moment. It will end when it ends. We will eliminate them; we have no other possibility. Otherwise we will be unable to live here in this area. But we need to buy time, which we also buy by turning to world leaders and to public opinion. You have an important role in influencing public opinion, which also influences leaders. We are in a war; it will continue. The war is not only to take care of the 1,400 people and perhaps more whom we lost – men and women, children and infants and things which are impossible to describe, but also to give us the maneuvering room. 

I would like to tell you that the entire nation and all citizens of Israel appreciate what you are doing. We always appreciate it, but today how much more so because the horrors are much greater, and you need to draw strength from this appreciation. This is the true expression of the unity of Israel. I want to tell you I am very impressed and full of appreciation. I thank you on behalf of all citizens of Israel"
23.11.2023,"Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, today, at the Prime Minister's Knesset office, met with Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez and Belgian Prime Minister Alexander De Croo. 

Prime Minister Netanyahu showed them sections of the horrific footage from the IDF Spokesperson's Office and told them afterwards:

""We face a peculiar kind of enemy, a particularly cruel and inhuman foe. 

They're genocidal. They're not fighting for this or that territory; they're fighting to eliminate the Jewish state in whatever boundary. They say so. Their charter says if you find a bush and a Jew is hiding behind it, kill the Jew. Kill all the Jews.

Their goal goes beyond the destruction of Israel. They're part of an axis of terror: Iran, Hezbollah, Hamas, Houthis. They say death to America—that's the Great Satan. Israel is the Small Satan. I hope I don't find any offense with any of you. You're a middle-sized Satan.

They hate our free civilization. They want to bury it. They have an ideology that is mad. In the 21st century, after the Enlightenment, after the Scientific Revolution, after the advance of human rights and democracy, this is sheer madness.

I don't give it relative moralism that says, moral relativism that says, well, they have this society. They can do these horrible things to women. They can do these horrible things to human beings. That's their value system. 

That's not a value system. That's something that has to be fought. And one thing that we discovered in the 21st century is that our assumption that we can live our civilized lives in our advanced countries, seeking peace, prosperity and progress, and we can just sit back and the barbarians will not come back, they come back. They come back in many places, and if we are unwilling to fight the barbarians, they will win.

There's a great historian that I admire, an American Christian Humanist by the name of Will Durant, who wrote, in the last century he wrote ""The History of Civilization."" And he said history does not favor Jesus Christ over Genghis Khan. History favors the strong. Your moral values do not stand up if you're not willing to fight for them. 

Here is a classic case of savagery and barbarism against civilization. Now, this savagery has two techniques. One is to deliberately target civilians. The whole laws of war, humanitarian law, which we're committed to completely, makes a simple distinction. On one line, they draw, they draw a line in the middle of the world and they say on one line are combatants, and the other line are non-combatants. You can target the combatants. You should target the combatants. But don't deliberately target the non-combatants. They can be hurt, unintentionally. That accompanies every legitimate war.

What the terrorists do is erase the sense of sin. They say everyone is a target. These girls in a music festival, these women. They're targets. Babies. They're targets. Old people. They're targets. Holocaust survivors. They're targets. Everyone is a combatant. Everyone! They not only target everyone, every citizen, no one is a civilian, no one is exempt from their murder, from their harm.

They also hide behind their civilians. They deliberately implant themselves in hospitals, in schools, in residential areas, in UN facilities. They fire their rockets from there. Thousands of them. We might have an alert as we speak. There is no symmetry here! These people target directly our cities all the time. Thousands and thousands and thousands of rockets. Falling on Barcelona, falling on Madrid, falling on Brussels, falling on Antwerp. Or any one of the European cities. Thousands! Israel is a small country. 

They deliberately target civilians and they deliberately hide behind civilians and use them as a human shield. That's a war crime.

So what is a democracy, committed to the human, to the laws of war, supposed to do? Do the laws of war give exemption to such criminals? And the answer is: They don't. They say do your best to target the terrorists. Do your best to minimize civilian casualties.

But if we, the democracies, accept, say that under no circumstances should we go in because civilians tragically get killed, then we lost. We lost before we begin. You lost and you lost. Spain lost. Belgium lost. Because this will spread. You will see it. Very soon. Because the Axis of Terror is not going to stop. If they can emerge victorious here, they intend to bring down the Middle East, and next they'll go to Europe. After that they'll go elsewhere.

If you think I'm exaggerating, I am not. This is where the pivot of history now is going to be decided. Do we stop them there? Or do they come to you? Now, how do you stop them? What do you do? What did the Western countries, what did the democracy do when terrorists embed themselves amidst civilians? 

Let me say from the start that any civilian death is a tragedy. Any one. And to avoid them, what you do is first, you try to get the civilians out of harm's way. And that's exactly what we did. We asked, called, sent leaflets, phoned the civilians in the areas where we were going to hit the terrorists, the Hamas terrorists, and we said please leave. When they tried to leave, Hamas kept them at gunpoint. Stay, because Hamas doesn't care that their civilians are killed. 

This is a messianic death cult that hides in the bunkers. As one of their spokesmen said: the underground belongs to Hamas; aboveground, so civilians, that's Israel's problem and the UN problem. Not their problem. On the contrary. It's their shield. So, what do you do?

We ask them to leave. Hamas tries to stop them from leaving. Thankfully, many left. We set up a safe corridor, from the north of Gaza, where we were concentrating our effort against the terrorists, to the south. A safe zone in the south, safe corridor to the south. Hamas shot the safe corridor. They fired on the safe corridor, so the people would be trapped in. But they kept on leaving. 

I'm happy to say that there is a decline in civilian casualties, which is our goal. Our goal is to have none. And primarily that's because of the ground action. The ground action has resulted in the fact that the warnings that we give are addressed by the population, the civilian population that goes south. When they go south, we give them humanitarian support. There are about 150 trucks now going in. Probably go up to 200 and beyond: food, medicine, water. I have not seen yet the effort that I'd like to see from the UN and the international agencies to build there shelters. Winter is coming and there is no reason not to build tens of thousands of tents in the safe zone, next to the safe zone. Because they don't enter the safe zone, the UN, which I think is shocking. I said, okay, we'll give you a lot of little zones. And they're building little safe zones to get the population out of harm's way.

Israel is doing everything in its power to get the population out of harm's way. Hamas is doing everything in its power to keep that population in harm's way. That's the facts. 

I'll give you an example – Hitler, the original Nazis, they invade Europe, they do these horrors on a mass scale. 

And by the way, these killers would do exactly what Hitler did if they could away with it. The difference is only in capability, not in intent and not in savagery. Hitler invades Europe, perpetrates these horrible savageries, the Holocaust and so on. And so on. And the Allies invade. They invade Normandy. The German army is in the cities. You've seen the footage. The Allies say, ""No, we can't do anything. We can't fire,"" because they're amid civilians? Of course not. They try to do exactly what we are doing: try to minimize the cost. And then they go through the cities of France and they go through the cities of Germany. And unfortunately, many, many, many civilian casualties occur. 

I don't know what history would have been like if we had demonstrations and protests in the West against the Allies for incurring civilian, German civilian casualties. I know history would have been very different. But we are the Allies, along with the moderate Arabs, with the United States, with Europe. We're the Allies. And they're the new Nazis. Israel cannot be held to a standard that no one is being held to. We have to fight the terrorists.

We're in complete compliance with international law. I think in many ways, we're setting a different standard. We seek to minimize civilian casualties, and Hamas seeks to maximize it. And I would strongly urge you to make that distinction, not merely because it's right and just, but because your very societies are on the line. You're next. 

This is a battle for civilization. It has to be won. We will win it, because we have no other choice. We don't have a future if we don't. Hamas has already said, 'We'll do it again and again and again.' So we'll have to eradicate them. Just as you couldn't leave a reduced Nazi presence, you know, in Germany. You couldn't do that. And we are not going to leave a reduced Hamas presence in Gaza. But the consequences are much bigger. And I think that we should all unite in making sure that this kind of savagery never shows its face again.

I thank you"
23.11.2023,"Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, today, at the Knesset in Jerusalem, met with UK Foreign Secretary and former Prime Minister David Cameron and said at the start of their meeting:

""Thank you, David, for coming here and standing with Israel. We hope to get our hostages out. It's not without its challenges. But we have to, we hope to get this first tranche out. And then we're committed to getting everyone out. 

We'll continue with our war aims, namely to eradicate Hamas, because Hamas has already promised that they will do this again and again and again. They're a genocidal terrorist cult. There's no hope for peace between Israel and the Palestinians, between Israel and the Arab states, if we don't eradicate this murderous movement that threatens the future of all of us.

It's a larger battle of civilization against barbarism, the kind of savagery that you saw on your visit. It's the worst savagery perpetrated on Jews since the Holocaust. And just as the world united to vanquish the Nazis or vanquish al-Qaeda after 9/11 or vanquish ISIS, we have to unite to vanquish Hamas.

Israel sustained proportionately twenty 9/11s – twenty 9/11s. It's as though 50,000 Americans were slaughtered in a single day and 10,000 were held hostage, including a nine-month-old baby. He can't walk, he can't talk, he's a hostage. What kind of people do this? The answer is these are not people; these are monsters. These monsters have to go. They'll go. We'll pursue the battle until that goal is achieved, and we give a different future for Gaza and for us.""

UK Foreign Secretary Cameron:

""I just want to say thank you very much for finding the time to see me. I wanted to come in person and go to the sites of the country and go to Kibbutz Be'eri to see just the true nature of the horrific attacks that you faced. I think it's very important to do that and see that. And, you know, we stand with the people of Israel in sympathy for what you have gone through. I think that was important.

Today, obviously, it's important we talk about this potential humanitarian pause. I think it's an opportunity to crucially get hostages out and to get aid into Gaza. There's never an excuse for this sort of hostage taking. All the hostages should be released. 

I hope everyone who's responsible and behind this agreement can make it happen, to bring relief to those families, including, of course, there are British nationals who have been taken hostage. And so that, let's hope that that can be delivered. Thank you for the time. There's lots of things to talk about. It's very good to see you again"
22.11.2023,"Citizens of Israel, at the start of my remarks, I would like to speak to the families of the hostages, our brothers and sisters. Last night, I convened the Government in order to approve the first stage of the outline for returning the hostages. Since the start of the war, I have not stopped thinking about you, the families. I have met with you and have heard from you what you are enduring. I have heard from you about the continuing nightmare, the tribulations of uncertainty, the endless worrying. When I meet with you, you put the photos of your loved ones on your chests, on your hearts, and I and my colleagues see all the photos; they are a call to action.
 
Since the outbreak of the war, we have indeed been working relentlessly to bring them all back home. And when I say all of them – I mean all of them, including Oron, Hadar, Avra and Hisham.
 
We have clearly defined the goals of the war: Eliminate Hamas, free our hostages and ensure that on the day after Hamas, Gaza will no longer constitute a threat to Israel. We said that we would act to create the conditions for returning the hostages and we created them. What paved the way to the current outline is the combination of two main efforts. The first effort, is the massive, relentless military pressure that we are using against Hamas. I want to commend the IDF and the ISA for the immense work that they are doing to create this pressure. The second effort is the great diplomatic pressure that we are using for the release of our hostages. We conducted difficult negotiations; we fought to improve the outline. I have just spoken again with President Biden and thanked him for acting, as per my request, with the intermediaries to significantly improve the outline; such an improvement has been achieved.
 
This combination of the military and diplomatic efforts created the conditions for returning our hostages. I believe that this combination will also facilitate the release of additional hostages in the next stages. The outline that has been achieved does not include the release of murderers. It does include visits by Red Cross representatives to the hostages and the delivery of medicines to them. I heard that there is someone denying this. The Red Cross says that it has not heard; then here is the explicit clause: 'The Red Cross will be allowed to visit the remaining hostages and provide them with needed medicine.' I expect the Red Cross to do its work.
 
Citizens of Israel, as Prime Minister of Israel, I frequently face tough decisions, between a difficult choice and an even more difficult choice. It is especially so on the issue of the hostages. The effort to bring all of them home is ongoing and at this time we can achieve the release of infants and children, mothers and women, who have swords at their necks. This is the precept of redeeming captives which we have a moral obligation to carry out.
 
In the history of the State of Israel, we have released hostages in highly feasible military operations. We have done this despite the heavy price that we have had to pay. It happened at the Savoy Hotel, at Entebbe, on a SABENA jet, and in other cases. It has also happened in this war; several weeks ago, we freed the soldier Ori Megidish in a daring military action. But military operations are not always possible. Therefore, we are not waiting. We are utilizing every sliver of opportunity to release our hostages because returning them is a sacred task.
 
The IDF and all of the security services fully support the outline. They reiterated at yesterday's Government meeting that the security of our forces will be assured during the days of the pause and that the intelligence effort will be maintained during these days. And the IDF will, at this time, be preparing for the continuation of the war.
 
This morning, the Government made a decision and I and my colleagues believe with all our hearts, that it was the correct decision. I thank my colleagues for the joint position – Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, Minister Benny Gantz and the Government ministers, IDF Chief-of-Staff Lt.-Gen. Herzi Halevi, Mossad Director David Barnea, ISA Director Ronen Bar, Maj.-Gen. (Ret.) Nitzan Alon, Brig.-Gen. (Ret.) Gal Hirsh and all those who have helped and who are working to achieve the release.
 
Citizens of Israel, I want to be clear – the war is continuing. The war is continuing. We will continue until we achieve all of our goals: Return all of the hostages, eliminate Hamas and ensure that on the day after Hamas, no element that supports terrorism, educates its children for terrorism, and pays terrorists or their families, will control Gaza. Gaza will no longer constitute a threat to Israel. We will restore security in both the south and the north. We are winning and will continue to fight until absolute victory. We are doing so thanks to the courage of our soldiers and thanks to the self-sacrifice of our sons and daughters, heroes of Israel. I always remember that this victory has a heavy price – our soldiers who gave their lives for us all, our heroes that fell to defend our home.
 
I spoke this evening with Avichai and Tali Barzani, whose son Dvir, a paratrooper, fell this week in the fighting in Gaza. Avichai is a veteran security man whom I have known for years. He told me that he wrote to his son Dvir: 'When you go to fight Hamas, remember that behind you are the 1,400 Israeli citizens who were brutally murdered by a terrible enemy.' Avichai and Tali asked me, as have all of the bereaved parents with whom I have spoken, to continue to the end, to continue until the absolute victory.
 
Citizens of Israel, I stand here this evening to tell you clearly: This is exactly what we will do.
 
Together we will fight and with God's help, together we will win"
21.11.2023,"Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, today, visited Rafael where he was briefed by Rafael Chairman Dr. Yuval Steinitz and CEO Yoav Har-Even on the activity of Rafael systems in the war, including Iron Dome, David's Sling, TROPHYand others.

 Chairman Steinitz and CEO Har-Even also briefed the Prime Minister on the activity to strengthen all of the company's facilities that has been carried out in conjunction with the IDF and all of the security services since the outbreak of the war on October 7th.

 Prime Minister Netanyahu also visited the company's production lines and met with Rafael employees who have been working 24/7 since the start of the war. The Prime Minister thanked them for their dedicated work in supplying the security establishment with all of the means necessary to continue the fighting.

 Prime Minister Netanyahu :

 ""I am here at Rafael which has, in effect, placed the Iron Dome over the country. Here is where they make the Iron Dome interceptors that block the missiles and rockets. Here is where they make many other things for both defense and offense. I want to thank the scientists, engineers, production line workers and everyone who is assisting in the unique effort here"
21.11.2023,"Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, today , met with soldiers of the 8101 Reserve Battalion – the Alexandroni Brgade, which came off the line along the eastern section of the Lebanese border a few days ago.

The Prime Minister was briefed by Battalion Commander Lt.-Col. (Res.) Ma'ayan Feldman on the battalion's activity in the northern sector in recent weeks and heard from the commanders about their impressions and experiences regarding the mobilization of reserves for lengthy operational duty. The commanders shared the battalion's fighting spirit, will and commitment of all those serving to continue working for, and contributing to the security of the State of Israel.

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu [translated from Hebrew]:

""I am here with Golani soldiers and commanders, with great spirit. They were just fighting in the north, are training here at Elyakim, and are going back. This is simply the spirit of a winning army. We are currently advancing on a very strong and pro-active defense in the north in order to achieve a crushing victory in the south.

The first goal is eliminating Hamas; we are not stopping until this is carried out. The second goal is the return of the hostages. I do not think that it is necessary to belabor the point, not even now, but I hope there will be good news soon. The third goal is to ensure that was in Gaza does not recur.

We want to restore security. We will work for, and achieve, the restoration of security in both the south and the north. The main tool that we have is the spirit of the people of Israel, which is expressed by the soldiers and commanders from all parts of Israeli society, and is simply very powerful. I want to salute you and tell you that we are continuing to victory. You have our heartfelt gratitude; tell your families"
16.11.2023,"Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his wife Sara, today , paid a condolence visit at the home of the family of the late Maj. Moshe Yedidya Leiter, a Shaldag Unit  company commander, who fell in battle in the Gaza Strip.

Members of the family told the Prime Minister and his wife about the incident in which Moshe fell in the Gaza Strip and about the character of Moshe who, apart from being a family man, a father of six children and a loving husband, was a brave and daring soldier. The family members said that Moshe set a personal example, and was a role model, for his soldiers – always the first to carry out the mission and always the first to attack.

The Prime Minister and his wife Sara embraced and expressed their support for the family members and many friends who came. Prime Minister Netanyahu shared how he personally coped with bereavement after his brother Yoni fell.

Yehiel Leiter, Moshe's father, served as Prime Minister Netanyahu's chief of staff when the latter served as Finance Minister. In their conversation, Yehiel Leiter asked the Prime Minister to continue to the end, until a decisive victory over Hamas. The Prime Minister said that he has sworn that this will be the case, and added that Hamas would be defeated with the help of the great spirit of the soldiers of the IDF and the people of Israel.

Yehiel Leiter also noted the amazing unity among the people and said: ""The IDF is not only the most moral army in the world regarding the enemy but it is also the most moral army in the world regarding its soldiers and their families"
15.11.2023,"The fact that you're coming here, standing with Israel in Israel is mightily important and gives us a lot of strength, a lot of encouragement. I have to say that the world today appears to be divided by two forces: those who support Israel and its just fight against Hamas terrorism, and those who support Hamas terrorism. 

I think, Reverend Graham, with your so many followers around the world, understand that Israel is fighting a just war, fighting according to international law, trying to minimize civilian casualties, root out the terrorists. And I think that's our common battle, the battle of civilization against barbarism.

I have to say that, by contrast, you know, there are forces that support the terrorists. And one of them is President Erdogan of Turkey, who calls Israel a terrorist state, but actually supports the terror state of Hamas, has himself bombed Turkish villages inside Turkey itself. So, we're not going to get any lectures from them. 

We stand with those who stand for justice and truth, like Reverend Graham, our many Christian friends around the world, but also so many others. We saw that yesterday in a mass demonstration in Washington of Jewish leaders and non-Jewish leaders – leaders of the Senate, leaders of the House. They stood for Israel. They stood for truth. They stood for justice. That's the forces of civilization that will ultimately win the day.""

Also participating in the meeting were the Strategic Affairs Minister, the National Security Council Director and the Prime Minister's Foreign Policy Adviser"
15.11.2023,"Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, today, visited an Iron Dome battery and an intercept control center, in the south, and evaluated the latter and its systems in real time as air defense soldiers considered whether or not a target was hostile and decided – in mere seconds – whether to launch an interceptor at it.

The Prime Minister also spoke with the soldiers and intercept personnel of the Southern Iron Dome Brigade, the 947 Brigade. Air Defense Commander Brig.-Gen. Gilad Biran and 947 Brigade commander Lt.-Col. Elad Zinman briefed the Prime Minister on air defense operations since the start of the war, the deployment of a record number of Iron Dome batteries throughout the country, the defense of the country and the interception of threats, and the very high proportion of success.

Brig.-Gen. Biran also reviewed the events of October 7th regarding Iron Dome in which the anti-missile defensive array thwarted an unprecedented aerial assault on the State of Israel and lost three of its soldiers – Lt. Sahar Saudian, Cpl. Binyamin Gavriel Yonah and Cpl. Nativ Kotzro – who operated batteries during the massacres.

Prime Minister Netanyahu to the soldiers:

""These fighting men and women who are operating our Iron Dome array are the shield of the State of Israel. People forget that since the start of the war, Hamas has launched around 10,000 rockets and missiles at the State of Israel in or der to kill our citizens.

You are doing sacred work in saving the citizens of the State of Israel. That is the difference between us and them: You are saving civilians while they sacrifice civilians and bring them into the war zone and do not allow them to leave, threatening them and even shooting at them so that they stay on the front line.

We face a brutal enemy but do not forget who we are; neither do we forget who you are. We greatly appreciate what you are doing, which of course assists us in the war effort"
15.11.2023,"I am here at the Zikim base with the staff instructors and the recruits who fought heroically here against terrorists who came to murder them, and they did fantastic work here. Ron kept her cool even though she took a bullet to the head, but all is well, thank G-d. The commanders who led the battle here, unfortunately several of their comrades fell but they did the work and saved many – by mobilizing, reading the battle and storming the terrorists. A great action took place here.

This reflects our spirit, our soldiers – not only in the battle to stop them but also in the ground assault now taking place in Gaza.

Do you remember that they told us not to advance into Gaza? We advanced. They told us not to reach the outskirts of Gaza City? We reached them. They told us not to enter Shifa – we entered it. It is in this spirit that we say something simple: There is no place in Gaza that we cannot reach. There are no hideouts. There is no shelter or refuge for the Hamas murderers. We will reach and eliminate Hamas and we will bring back our hostages. These are two sacred missions.

Yesterday evening, I spoke again with US President Biden. We will not let up. We will eliminate Hamas, achieve total victory and bring back our hostages, with your help and that of G-d.

Thank you"
14.11.2023,"Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, today, at the Regba control center in the Mateh Asher Regional Council, met with northern confrontation line council heads and heard about the essential need for the continued implementation of the plan for structural reinforcement in the north, including budgeting.

The council heads called on Prime Minister Netanyahu to continue the fighting and not relent until the completion of the mission: The return of the hostages, security for the confrontation line communities – personal security alongside economic security.

At the conclusion of the meeting, Prime Minister Netanyahu and the council heads were photographed against the backdrop of photos of the hostages in the hope of their swift return.

Prime Minister Netanyahu at the conclusion of the meeting :

""I am here after an excellent, in-depth, serious and pointed meeting with northern council heads, here in the moshav of Regba. There is steadfast resilience here, theirs and their residents', which are enduring difficult days, but are enduring them together. I must say that this resilience is an integral part of our effort to achieve the objectives of the war.

We have an orderly plan: First of all, our goal is the absolute victory over Hamas in the south and the return of our hostages. Second, of course, is to ensure that Hamas – or anything like it – does not return on the day after; we will ensure this as well. Third, and no less important, is to deal with the northern front here.

On the northern front, there are currently exchanges of severe blows. We are striking Hezbollah but my directive to the IDF is to prepare for any scenario. I suggest that Hezbollah not try the State of Israel; it will be the mistake of its life.

We are committed to restoring security to the citizens of Israel in both the south and the north. This is what we will do. I thank you, dear friends, for your fantastic resilience"
13.11.2023,"Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, today, visited the men and women soldiers of the Caracal Battalion, at one of the assembly points near the Gaza Strip fence.

The Prime Minister was briefed on the activity of the battalion on Saturday October 7th and how the soldiers – led by their battalion commander and the commander of the Paran Brigade – fought in the communities of the area adjacent to the southern Gaza Strip. The Prime Minister heard how the battalion fought against dozens of terrorists and killed many, and said that, ""This was an extraordinary achievement.""

Prime Minister Netanyahu to the soldiers:

""An extraordinary achievement, truly amazing; there are no words. I think that what you have done here – you simply decided the battle here, men and women soldiers, with daring and extraordinary resourcefulness. Well done. This says a lot, to turn the tide from the worst situation imaginable, this says a lot.

This is also what we are doing now with the forces that are inside. This is neither an 'operation' nor a 'round' but a war to the end. It is important to me that you know this. This is not lip service, but from the heart and mind. If we do not finish them, it will come back.

What you did here was exemplary, simply exemplary. I am very impressed by the speed, the resourcefulness, the mobilization, the heroism and the decisiveness. You simply decided the battle here. This says it all. Well done.""

Prime Minister Netanyahu added:

""I have just come from the Bedouin Desert Patrol Battalion. You see there Jews and Bedouin fighting shoulder-to-shoulder, like you are fighting here, men and women soldiers shoulder-to-shoulder. This is amazing. This is how we win and proceed onward.

I am simply full of admiration for what you have done. This will be written about and noted for many years. You are young enough so that your children and grandchildren will also know this"
13.11.2023,"Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu Visits IDF (Bedouin) Desert Patrol Battalion: ""Jewish and Bedouin commanders are standing shoulder-to-shoulder. They have fought, and are now fighting, heroically. Our partnership is the future of us all against these savages.""

Prime Minister Netanyahu on the exchanges of fire in the North: ""There is someone who thinks he can expand the attacks against our forces and our civilians; this is playing with fire. Fire will be met by much stronger fire. They should not try us because we have shown only a little of our might.""

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, today visited IDF Desert Patrol Battalion 585 (the Bedouin Patrol Battalion), which is under the command of the Southern Brigade.

The Prime Minister was briefed on the activity of the unit by Acting Battalion Commander Lt.-Col. Nader Eyadat, and spoke with the commanders on the combat they led on October 7th in clearing the area.

Prime Minister Netanyahu to the soldiers:

""I am here with the Bedouin Patrol Battalion, with commander Nader Eyadat and his highly motivated soldiers. Jewish and Bedouin commanders are standing shoulder-to-shoulder. They have fought, and are now fighting, heroically. They are safeguarding our country in an exemplary manner and in full partnership.

I salute you and rely on you. You are the future of us all. Our partnership is the future of us all against these savages. You are all imbued with the same goal – we are going to win. There are no breaks here. There is no half-way. This is neither an 'operation' nor a 'round'. We are going for total victory here.

I see your determination. Despite all of the pain, very considerable pain, I see level-headedness and the commitment to complete the mission. In the war, we will win. This is our fight and the main fight is here.

We also have exchanges of fire in the north, you know this. In these exchanges of fire in the north, there is someone who thinks he can expand the attacks against our forces and our civilians; this is playing with fire. Fire will be met by much stronger fire. They should not try us because we have shown only a little of our might. Any attack against us – we will attack those who attack us.

We will restore security to the north and we will restore security to the south. We will restore security to the State of Israel, but first of all, there will be victory here – Hamas will be eliminated.

I believe in you. I salute you, each and every one of you, I truly salute you. Well done"
12.11.2023,"At the start of the meeting, the delegation presented Prime Minister Netanyahu with two declarations supporting Israel and its right to defend itself and to defeat Hamas: One declaration by the Senate and one by the House of Representatives. The Prime Minister thanked them for the declarations of support.

Prime Minister Netanyahu on the declarations of support:

""This is an expression of the will, the resolve and the moral clarity of the American people as represented by its representatives. So we thank you deeply. We say that the only thing greater than standing with Israel is standing in Israel, and we appreciate the fact that you're here. And we appreciate deeply your support.""

Prime Minister Netanyahu added:

""I have to say that the moral clarity that I was talking about is the fact that the American people, through the Senate and the Congress, and in broad swaths of the American public, understand that this is a battle of civilization against barbarism. Israel stands at that front line, but it's fighting not only for itself, but fighting also for America, for the free world and for the hope of progress against these barbarians.""

Attending the meeting for the Israeli side were the Minister for Strategic Affairs, the Prime Minister's Chief of Staff, the Prime Minister's Military Secretary and the Prime Minister's Foreign Policy Adviser"
10.11.2023,"Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his wife Sara, met with the family of Golani Reconnaissance Unit Soldier Pdaya Mark, who fell in the fighting in Gaza one week ago. They listened to the members of his family who described Pdaya's unique and inspiring personality, offered the family their support, and conveyed their condolences over the terrible loss. The Prime Minister shared with them how he has coped with bereavement after the loss of his brother Yoni.

Sara Netanyahu said that the letter that Pdaya Mark sent to his family showed his great spirit and faith, after his late cousin Elhanan fell in battle on the outbreak of the war.

Family members said that even if Pdaya had known the end of the story, he would have entered Gaza and done everything. They added that while he has been taken, Hamas will never be able to take his spirit.

Prime Minister Netanyahu responded [translated from Hebrew]:

""The faith and strength, and with everything that your family has endured and that you are enduring today, this is the challenge for the people of Israel. The land of Israel is acquired by tribulations. The pain is very great but we will win thanks to this spirit.""

Prime Minister Netanyahu met Pdaya Mark four months ago at IDF Training Base #1, when the latter completed the officers; course"
08.11.2023,"At the start of my remarks, I would like to commend the IDF ground action in the Gaza Strip. It is advancing well and is achieving good results. I would like to set aside all kinds of false rumors that we are hearing from all sorts of directions and re-clarify one thing: There will be no ceasefire without the release of our hostages. Everything else is false.

I am here with the War Cabinet, the council heads from Judea and Samaria and, of course, with IDF Central Command. We have come here to accomplish three goals: The first goal is to step up counter-terrorism, which is being done aggressively. I would like to commend the IDF, the ISA and the Israel Police for their very impressive action in this field.

The second objective is to prevent escalation and Judea and Samaria from becoming a second front. Of course, this requires preparing for large-scale attacks in Judea and Samaria, and from Judea and Samaria. The third reason is a handful of extremists that do not represent the public that is sitting here, and which causes great damage to the State of Israel.

There are half a million loyal, law-abiding residents in Judea and Samaria, who do dedicated work. Now, many of them are either career IDF officers or reservists on the frontline In Gaza. These citizens have contributed greatly to the State of Israel over the years and are meeting challenges that the citizens of Israel know are both difficult and obligatory. They have consistently upheld ethical values and norms of conduct of the highest order.

There is a tiny handful of people that do not represent this public and that take the law into their own hands. We are not prepared to tolerate this. We are not prepared to accept this. We will take all action against them. This causes severe international damage to the State of Israel and it does not represent the public here. I condemn this and we will act against it, and I know that I represent all of the people sitting here – the heads of the communities in Judea and Samaria and the residents of Judea and Samaria. Thank you very much"
07.11.2023,"Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, today, visited the Ashdod city control center, which was activated at the start of the war. The Prime Minister met with Ashdod Mayor Yechiel Lasri and with the various security heads in the city. Prime Minister Netanyahu was briefed by the Mayor and the city security head on rocket hits in Ashdod, on the public security situation and on the state of business activity in the city.
 
Prime Minister Netanyahu in the control center:
 
""We need national resilience and patience. We also need international leeway, and I am working overtime on this. We need the fighting spirit of the commanders and soldiers, which is amazing.
 
We need patience because we need to complete the work. I do not want 'half' or 'more or less' – I want to eliminate Hamas. What will be afterward, I do not know, but first of all, Hamas must be eliminated. Less than this will not suffice.
 
To this end, we really need the civil home front. First of all, the home front must be defended, so that the home front will give us the strength to continue as well. This will take time. But we, both the military and political leaderships, are very determined to complete the war, to complete this mission, and not give up.
 
Everyone does their part. I am impressed that you are doing your part in the best way possible. I very much appreciate that"
07.11.2023,"Citizens of Israel, I would like to update you on the continuation of the war. In the south, the war in the Gaza Strip is proceeding with a fervor that Hamas has never known. Gaza City is surrounded. We are operating in it. We are intensifying the pressure on Hamas on an hourly basis, every day.

As of now, we have eliminated thousands of terrorists above ground – and below ground. Among them, we have eliminated arch-murderers who planned and perpetrated the terrible massacre on that black Shabbat one month ago. Since the start of the ground incursion, we have destroyed countless Hamas command centers, tunnels, bases and installations. Hamas is discovering that we can go to places they did not think we could, and the campaign is continuing.

I have just come from our soldiers at the Tze'elim base. Some of them were in the area adjacent to the Gaza Strip and fought with extraordinary heroism on the first day of fighting. Afterwards, they fought with the determination and heroism in the north. Now they are preparing to enter the Gaza Strip, equipped with two great advantages. First – the lessons that the IDF is systematically and prudently learning from the operations of our forces inside Gaza, lessons that are improving the results of the fighting even more. The second – and most important – advantage is that they are equipped with a fighting spirit that is second to none. They have extraordinary heroism. They have faith and, above all, they have a sense of mission. They are defending our home. I salute them; the entire people of Israel salutes them.

In the north, we are operating defensively and offensively. We will continue to defend our border. We will not accept a reality in which Hezbollah or those who do its bidding, Hamas in Lebanon, attack our communities and our citizens. We will continue to respond with heavy fire to any attack against us. We have attacked many Hezbollah targets and have eliminated many terrorists. I reiterate: If Hezbollah decides to enter the war – it will be making the mistake of its life.

Regarding our hostages, I have spoken with the President of the Red Cross. I demanded from her that the Red Cross act toward the immediate release of our hostages, as required by international law. I also demanded that the Red Cross carry out its obligation and immediately visit all of the hostages in order to verify their health and well-being.

Yesterday, I convened all of the foreign ambassadors to Israel. I called on them to join Israel's demand for the immediate release of all of the hostages. I told them that their abduction is a war crime. I reiterate to our enemies and friends alike: There will be no ceasefire without the return of our hostages.

From here I turn to the hostages' families, who are enduring an ongoing nightmare: I want you to know that we are using all means, on all fronts, in order to bring your loved ones – our loved ones – back home. The military action is a vital part of this effort.

On the diplomatic front, we are working around the clock to provide the IDF with international maneuvering room for continued military activity. We are bringing here leaders from countries around the world. I meet with them and show them the horrors of Hamas. I show them the heroism of our citizens and our soldiers. I tell them: Our war is your war because if we do not win, you are next in line. I always add: We will win. We will not stop until victory.

I am in continuous contact with US President Joe Biden. We appreciate his support, that of the US administration and that of the American people.

Citizens of Israel, last month, on the black day of October 7th, a brutal war was forced on us by an enemy whose cruelty is unparalleled, and who sought to slaughter us. This enemy will be struck severely. He will be destroyed. We will eliminate Hamas's military and governing capabilities. Gaza will no longer constitute a threat to Israel. Once again, I call on the civilian population in Gaza – evacuate southward. You are already doing so; complete it. We will not stop. I repeat: There will be no entry of fuel or workers, and there will be no ceasefire without the release of our hostages.

On the economic issue, my directive to the government and to the ministers is absolutely clear: Lift all of the impediments, open all the taps, attend to all the injured, attend to all the civilians and make certain that nobody is left behind. We have evacuated over 100,000 people from the northern and southern borders. We are working to return them. We are working, first of all, to rehabilitate the communities, including the moshavim and kibbutzim. We will invest all the necessary capital, effort and heart in this. We are giving full and increased payment to reservists, compensation to workers and compensation to businesses.

Something else, the home front. Today I visited the command center for the city of Ashdod. I saw the resilience of the leadership and of the residents. I would like to tell you, citizens of Israel: Your resilience, and your determination to continue until victory, are what gives us – the government and the IDF – the strength to complete the task.

Citizens of Israel, all of our hearts are with the families of those who were murdered and the families of the hostages. We embrace the bereaved families of our soldiers who gave their lives for our state. We wish a speedy recovery to the wounded and pray for them. We strongly support our brave soldiers. I tell you with certainty: Out of the darkness and pain, we will emerge stronger, better prepared and more united. Together we will fight and with God's help, together we will win"
07.11.2023,"I would like to tell you that what we see on the ground, from the reports the War Cabinet and I receive, and the conversations with commanders and soldiers, it is an extraordinary success. I tell you, the Americans were here. They explained to us what was in Fallujah and what was here and there, and they are amazed at what we have achieved.

True, there are problems. There are UAVs, IEDs and anti-tank fire. That is true. Sometimes there are very painful losses but all in all, the success is phenomenal because we went in there and hit the enemy – this is a great success. We do not intend to stop; we intend to continue to the end.

We rely on you, believe in you and are giving you all the force. We know that you will do everything. Of course, you will watch out for each other – that is the first rule.

You should have all the force, all of the success. Thank you. Learn the lessons; the lessons are very good, with a lot of wisdom. May you succeed; spirit you already have.""

Prime Minister Netanyahu was briefed on activity at the Training Center, through which thousands of conscript and reserve soldiers have passed in recent weeks for training by the commanders and division heads ahead of the ground incursion into Gaza.

The Prime Minister also observed an exercise by officer cadets as well as an exhibit of the munitions used by Egoz Unit soldiers, with whom he spoke.

The commanders and soldiers told Prime Minister Netanyahu about the fighting they participated in on the morning of Saturday October 7th and the operations they have taken part in recent weeks"
06.11.2023,"Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, today, at the Kirya in Tel Aviv, met with approximately 80 foreign ambassadors, who expressed their support for Israel and who said that they would work – each one in their own country – so that what occurred on October 7th would never be forgotten.

Prime Minister Netanyahu to the ambassadors:

""What we see is a broader battle between civilization and barbarism. The barbarism is led by an axis of terror. The axis of terror is led by Iran. It includes Hezbollah, Hamas, Houthis and their other minions. They seek to bring the Middle East and the world back to a dark age. They seek to torpedo, to derail any progress towards peace and the progress and the promise that we had in our budding peace treaties with our Arab neighbors. If they go strong, if they're not defeated, they will derail this process, they will imperil the entire Middle East. If the Middle East falls to the axis of terror, Europe will be next and no one will be safe. This is not a local battle. This is a global battle. The paramount need is to defeat this axis.

That battle is now being waged by us against Hamas in Gaza. There is no substitute for victory. We will defeat Hamas. We will dismantle Hamas. We will offer the people of Gaza and the entire peoples of the Middle East a real future, a future of promise and hope. But this requires victory. We have the will and we have the power to do so. We will win. And we believe that all civilized powers should back us in this effort because this battle is your battle and our victory is your victory.""

In response to a question on how it is possible to assist Israel, the Prime Minister said:

""First, to stand with Israel. I think that all civilized countries should stand with Israel because this is our common fight. And as I said, our battle is your battle and our victory is your victory.

I also spoke yesterday to the president of the Red Cross and I asked her to personally be involved in an effort that we've been talking to the Red Cross from day one of the war, that is to demand an immediate and unconditional release of the hostages and access to the hostages and information about the hostages. Something that is required by humanitarian international law and Hamas violates as well.

I think you should back that call. You should be part of that call every day.

We want the release, the unconditional release of our hostages immediately. We want that information. We want that access to the Red Cross"
06.11.2023,"Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, today, at the Prime Minister's Office in Jerusalem, met with Bulgarian Prime Minister Nikolay Denkov.

Prime Minister Netanyahu at the start of the meeting:

""Prime Minister, welcome. Thank you for coming and standing with Israel in Israel. Your support is very important. We appreciate the support of the entire people of Bulgaria.""

Bulgarian Prime Minister Denkov:

""We're here really to express our strong support of Israel and its citizens. We know how a difficult time it is today and that's why we have to be here.

We were all shocked by the terrorist attacks that killed so many innocent people. And it is extremely important that all the hostages can be released as soon as possible. And at least, the international community, the Red Cross, should have access to them, again, immediately. It was really shocking to see the attacks that killed these people here in Israel.

We want to say that Hamas and all its military and administrative structure should be eradicated because this cannot continue like that. On the same time, in this second month of this war, we are concerned of what happens in the Gaza Strip. So we know that you have all the rights to defend yourself in the frames of the humanitarian international law, and the international law, but it's also important to have this humanitarian aid without allowing it to be abused by the people there.

And again, I want to express our full support for Israel and your people.""

Prime Minister Netanyahu:

""Thank you, Prime Minister. You expressed very much our positions. We think that we're not only fighting our war, we think we're fighting the battle of civilization against barbarism.

If civilization doesn't prevail, barbarism will. That's what we see in the 21st century. This is not only our battle, it's your battle as well and I think you understand that very well.

We also are fighting an enemy, this most savage enemy that we have seen since the Holocaust, that commits a double war crime: not only deliberately targeting civilians but deliberately using their civilians as human shields. And while Israel is doing everything in its power to get the civilians out of harm's way, Hamas is doing everything in its power to keep them in harm's way, sometimes as gunpoint.

So we will act, and not only in our right of self-defense but in defending our common values and our future, but also in a way that minimizes civilian casualties.

And I thank you again for your steadfast support. Thank you"
05.11.2023,"Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, today , visited the Ramon Air Force Base and met with air crew combat personnel and ground crew personnel. At the start of the visit, the Prime Minister was briefed by the base commander, Col. G on the activities of the squadron and the combat helicopters during the fighting in the Gaza Strip, including air attacks and providing close support to ground forces currently active in the Strip. The base commander emphasized the cooperation and close links between air units and the ground forces.

Prime Minister Netanyahu then met and spoke with air crews that have participated in the fighting, and was briefed on the use of F-16I fighter jets. He also spoke with technical crews at the base who are responsible for maintaining and arming the aircraft.

Prime Minister Netanyahu:

""I thank you. Our enemies misjudged us. They thought that on the crucial day we would not report. We reported together and now we are fighting shoulder-to-shoulder.

I also want you to know that there is one thing we will not do: There will be no ceasefire without the return of the hostages. This should be completely removed from the lexicon. We say this to our friends and to our enemies. We will simply continue until we defeat them. We have no alternative. I think that we all understand this today.

The entire nation is united and relies on you, appreciates what you are doing and believes in you. We will continue together until victory"
03.11.2023,"Dear citizens of Israel,

As we welcome the Sabbath, I want to update you on the progress of the war. Our forces are operating on all of fronts, with full power. Our victory will be decisive and clear. It will send a message to our enemies – one that will echo for generations.

The objective of our enemies is to destroy the State of Israel. I am telling you and I am telling them: our enemies will fail. They will be defeated. We will not cease until we achieve victory and meet our defined objectives: eliminating Hamas, the return of our hostages and restoring security for our children and citizens.

Our soldiers are fighting with remarkable courage. They are taking part in intense battles, facing the enemy and killing terrorists around the clock. The various IDF branches are operating jointly, and they are accompanied by ongoing and unprecedented Air Force airstrikes against Hamas-ISIS. As for the northern front, I reiterate to our enemies – do not be mistaken about us. Such a mistake will be very costly. You will pay an unimaginable price.

At the same time, we continue to work on the diplomatic front. I met with American Secretary of State Antony Blinken this morning. I appreciate his visit here. I appreciate the consistent support of President Biden, the American administration and the American people. I showed Secretary of State Blinken a video from the cameras in the Gaza Strip, and he talked about it. One of the terrible things that we saw was two boys, brothers, who witnessed their father's murder. One of them, who lost his eyesight, was calling for his mother. That is only one of the horrors in the video.

I made it clear that we are going with full steam ahead, and that Israel refuses any temporary ceasefire that does not involve the release of the kidnapped Israelis. Israel is not allowing fuel into Gaza and objects to funds being transferred into the Strip. 

Citizens of Israel, since this terrible war broke out on that Black Saturday, we have lost hundreds of citizens, fighters, soldiers, and those serving in the security forces, the police and the rescue services. We lost excellent fighters, exceptional Israelis, the salt of the earth. People who warded off the monsters with their bodies, sometimes using their fingernails to fight them off.

I would like to tell you some stories of courage of fallen soldiers from this past week.

Roei Dawi, a fighter in the Givati Brigade, was killed in combat in the north of the Gaza Strip. A farewell letter that he had written to his family was found in his mobile phone. He wrote: ""I had the best army service I could have asked for. The soldiers I command are lions. It is my privilege to be their commander. Seeing everyone here, this is the Israel I am doing this for.""

Pdaya Mark, a fighter in the Givati Brigade, was killed this week in combat in Gaza. I met Pdaya only four months ago when he graduated the IDF officer course. Pdaya told me about his father, Miki, who was murdered in a terrorist attack. Pdaya survived the attack but his mother was badly injured. His cousin, Elhanan, was killed while rescuing families from the communities in the Gaza Envelope, on that cursed Saturday of October 7th. In his last letter, Pdaya Mark wrote to his family: ""We are strong. The nation of Israel is strong and the IDF is strong. I am protecting you, and keeping you in my heart"".

Lt. Col. Salman Habaka, commander of the 53rd Battalion of the 188th Barak Armored Brigade, was killed in combat in the north of the Gaza Strip. Salman, a Druze, was one of the first soldiers to fight the terrorists in Kibbutz Be'eri. He talked about his tank entering the kibbutz. He wrote: ""I realized that when the people heard the tanks' tracks, it gave them a sense of security."" He granted people security in his last moments.

Each of our fallen soldiers leaves a gaping hole in our hearts. Each of them is an entire world for their families, friends, parents and for all of us. Each of them sacrificed their lives so that we could live ours. On behalf of the people of Israel, I share the grief of the bereaved families. I am familiar with the depths of sorrow that bereavement brings. We ache for each fallen soldier. We are trying to operate with minimum risk to our forces, but we will do everything we need to do to defeat our enemies.

With the help of God and with your help, citizens of Israel, we shall be triumphant. Together, we will win.

Shabbat Shalom"
02.11.2023,"Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, today (Thursday, 2 November 2023), visited the IDF Marom Brigade at the Adam Base and met with soldiers from various elite units.

The Prime Minister was briefed by the units' commanders on their activities in recent weeks, including rescuing civilians and clearing terrorists from the area adjacent to the Gaza Strip, as well as refresher exercises for marksmanship and sniper teams, and emergency squads from around the country, and training forces ahead of the ground incursion.

Prime Minister Netanyahu also observed an exhibition of the elite units' unique operational capabilities, and the use of the units' special equipment, which will be used in the fighting in Gaza and various additional sectors.

Prime Minister Netanyahu:

""I am here at the Marom Brigade with the elite units, which are doing sacred work. The men and women fighters, who in the hours immediately after the attack, even in the first hour, went to the site, fought heroically, saved people, lost comrades and blocked the enemy.

We are in the midst of the campaign. We have very impressive successes. We are already on the outskirts of Gaza City. We are advancing.

We also have losses, painful losses, because every soldier who falls is an entire world, and our hearts are with the families. But I want to make one thing clear, one of the soldiers said it just now – nothing will stop us.

I call on non-combatants – leave, go south because we will not stop our action to eliminate the Hamas terrorists.

We will advance. We will advance and win, and we will do so with G-d's help and the help of our heroic soldiers.

I rely on you. I believe in you. The entire people of Israel stands behind you until victory"

At the start of the meeting, the Prime Minister commended the Finance Minister and the other ministers on the appointment of Tal Basechess as civilian control center project manager.
 
All Cabinet ministers proposed various issues from their ministries that can be dealt with. Upon the convening of the control center forthwith, the issues will be concentrated and handled as quickly as possible.
 
Prime Minister Netanyahu [translated from Hebrew]:
 
""The Socio-Economic Cabinet is convening for important work. Very important steps have been taken: The allocation of funds, assistance to the citizens of Israel and the economy – and there is much more still to do.
 
The first goal is to maintain Israel's macro-economic framework so that the economy will function and not collapse.
 
The second goal is to allow the IDF and the security services to conduct the war. This will cost a lot of money, which we are channeling every day.
 
The third goal is to make sure that reservists, who have mobilized in an unprecedented manner, are not hurt.
 
The fourth goal is make sure that civilians and businesses that have been hurt as a result of the war are properly compensated.
 
The fifth goal is to move the economy forward to continued growth, by encouraging consumption and employment, as well as by assisting citizens.
 
The sixth goal is to rehabilitate the communities of the area adjacent to the Gaza Strip. We established the _Tekuma_ Authority and are also dealing with evacuees in both thre north and the south.
 
There are many other goals but this summarizes and focuses the Cabinet's main work.""
 
Finance Minister Smotrich [translated from Hebrew]:
 
""The Prime Minister has presented the goals very well. The most central goal is how to combine all of these goals and to balance them, how to make the right decisions, swiftly and with minimal bureaucracy and processes so that things happen quickly.
 
Mr. Prime Minister, thank you for finding the time from your many security concerns to come here, to give the commander's spirit. Thank you to all the ministers for holding an excellent discussion in which needs were raised. Thank you to Tal Basechess, the Director General of the Israel association of Community Centers Ltd, who is now assuming the post of civilian control center project manager. Thank you to everyone for mobilizing and joining hands. Thank you, of course, to the Prime Minister and the Finance Ministry Director General.
 
We are joining hands and working. With God's help from now on we will work much better."
30.10.2023,"Until recently, many believed״ that the promise of progress of the 21st century would enable us to move beyond the barbaric horrors of the past towards a better and brilliant future. Many believed that we could go about our comfortable lives and that evil will simply pass us by.
It will not.

The horrors that Hamas perpetrated on October 7th remind us that we will not realize the promise of a better future unless we, the civilized world, are willing to fight the barbarians. Because the barbarians are willing to fight us. And their goal is clear: Shatter that promising future, destroy all that we cherish and usher in a world of fear and darkness. 

Ladies and Gentlemen, This is a turning point, a turning point for leaders and nations. It is time for all of us to decide if we are willing to fight for a future of hope and promise; or surrender to tyranny and terror.
Now rest assured, Israel will fight. Since October 7th, Israel has been at war. Israel did not start this war. Israel did not want this war. But Israel will win this 
war.

Hamas launched this war by perpetrating the worst savagery our people have seen since the Holocaust. Hamas murdered children in front of their parents. Murdered parents in front of their children. They burnt people alive. They raped women. They beheaded men. They tortured Holocaust survivors. They kidnapped babies. They committed the most horrific crimes imaginable.
And they’re a part of the axis of evil Iran has formed, an axis of terror that works by arming, training and financing Hamas in Gaza, Hezbollah in Lebanon, the Houthis in Yemen and other terror proxies throughout the Middle East and beyond the 
Middle East. 

In fighting Hamas and the Iranian axis of terror, Israel is fighting the enemies of civilization itself. Victory over these enemies begins with moral clarity. It begins with knowing the difference between good and evil, between right and wrong. It means making a moral distinction between the deliberate murder of the innocent and the unintentional casualties that accompany every legitimate war, even the most just war. It means holding Hamas responsible for the double war crime it commits every day by deliberately targeting Israeli civilians while using Palestinians civilians as human shields. It means making clear that the use of human shields is not only an immoral tactic of terror but also an ineffective one. 
Because as long as Hamas's use of Palestinian human shields results in the international community blaming Israel, Hamas will continue to use it as a tool of terror, and so will others. 

Hamas will continue to use the basements in Gaza’s hospitals as the command posts of its vast terror tunnel network. It will continue to use mosques as fortified military positions and weapons depots. It will continue to steal fuel and humanitarian assistance from UN facilities.
While Israel is doing everything to get Palestinian civilians out of harm’s way, Hamas is doing everything to keep Palestinian civilians in harm’s way.

Israel urges Palestinian civilians to leave the areas of armed conflict, while Hamas prevents those civilians from leaving those areas at gunpoint.
Hamas is also preventing foreign nationals from leaving Gaza altogether. And most despicably, Hamas is holding over 200 Israelis hostage, including 33 children. Holding them, terrorizing them, keeping them as hostages
Every civilized nation should stand with Israel in demanding that these hostages be freed immediately and freed unconditionally.

I want to make clear Israel’s position regarding a cease-fire. Just as the United States would not agree to a ceasefire after the bombing of Pearl Harbor or after the terrorist attack of 9/11, Israel will not agree to a cessation of hostilities with Hamas after the horrific attacks of October 7th.

Calls for a ceasefire are calls for Israel to surrender to Hamas, to surrender to terrorism, to surrender to barbarism. That will not happen.

Ladies and Gentlemen,
The Bible says that there is a time for peace and a time for war. This is a time for war – a war for our common future.
Today, we draw a line is between the forces of civilization and the forces of barbarism. It is a time for everyone to decide where they stand. Israel will stand against the forces of barbarism until victory.

I hope and pray that civilized nations everywhere will back this fight, because Israel's fight is your fight. Because if Hamas and Iran’s axis of evil win – you will be their next target.   
That’s why Israel's victory will be your victory. But make no mistake. Regardless of who stands with Israel, Israel will fight until this battle is won. And Israel will prevail. May God Bless Israel and May God Bless all those who stand with Israel"
30.10.2023,"Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, today, in central Israel, visited the Israel Police Unit 33 (the Gidonim), together with National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir and Israel Police Inspector General Koby Shabtai.

Prime Minister Netanyahu was briefed by the commander of the Unit on the battles it fought in the Kfar Aza district, at the 'Black Arrow' memorial, and in the Southern Command area. The Prime Minister observed the operation of the forward command post and additional classified capability.

Prime Minister Netanyahu also observed an exercise, which combined undercover work, deception and an arrest in a simulated Arab area.

The Prime Minister concluded his visit by speaking with Unit fighters, most of whom had been in combat in the south. He thanked them, who together with the Israel Police, IDF and ISA, fought, and are fighting, with great daring for the security of the state.

Prime Minister Netanyahu to the Gidonim:

""I am here with the National Security Minister and the Inspector General, and the elite Gidonim unit. The unit fights throughout the year, including on that cursed day, on that cursed weekend.

Over 50 police officers gave their lives to save the citizens of the State of Israel. We bow our heads in their memory and to their heroism and sacrifice.

The Israel Police, under the Inspector General, is doing sacred work, around the clock, to protect us, including this morning, and all citizens of Israel are indebted to them, especially at this time. I salute you.

You also work in full cooperation with other forces, and with the ISA. The ISA, under its Director, has done – and is doing – major covert work, also together with the other security services, including covert work that constantly saves lives. I salute them.

And of course, all of the security services work together with you, with the Chief-of-Staff, with the commanders and with the IDF, on the frontlines and are defending our homeland.

We are fighting for our home, and we will win. With the help of these people and others who are imbued with fighting spirit, sacrifice and the spirit of victory.

Thank you"
29.10.2023,"At the start of his visit, the Prime Minister was briefed by Navy Commander Vice Admiral David Saar, Ashdod Base Commander Col. Eitan Paz and additional Israel Navy commanders on naval activity during the war and the thwarting of dozens of terrorists who tried to infiltrate by sea.

Prime Minister Netanyahu then spoke with naval commandos and fighters from various units who took part in the fighting. He heard from them about their mission to defend Israel's coast, the efforts to clear out the communities in the area adjacent to the Gaza Strip and their offensive actions on the Gaza coast, which included targeting terrorist infrastructure and eliminating Hamas terrorists and senior commanders. The Prime Minister commended them for their quick and determined action from the moment the war broke out.

Prime Minister Netanyahu then proceeded to a briefing at sea aboard a Dvora-class patrol boat off Israel's southern coast, together with navy fighters, who also accompanied him in other vessels.

Prime Minister Netanyahu:

""You fighters are lions of the sea. From the first moment of combat, some of you in the communities and most of you from here, you did simply amazing work, in combat and in stopping their incursions.

I just received reports, both personally from each one of you and I also saw videos of your amazing work defending the country. You stopped them and you are still stopping them. You killed them and did not allow them to come in.

Navy Commander, you have lions here, the fighters who fought, and are fighting, wonderfully. I want to tell you – you are encompassed by a sea of love and appreciation by the citizens of Israel. You protect the citizens of Israel; you protect our home. I salute you; well done"
28.10.2023,"Citizens of Israel, yesterday evening, additional ground forces of ours entered the gates of Gaza, at the doorstep of the fortress of evil. This is the second stage of the war, the goals of which are clear: Destroying Hamas's military and governing capabilities, and bringing the captives back home. We made the decision to expand ground operations unanimously, both in the War Cabinet and in the Security Cabinet. We did this in a balanced and considered way, based on a commitment to ensure both the destiny of the state and the security of our soldiers. The commanders and soldiers are now fighting on enemy territory knowing that the people and the leadership of the people are behind them.

In recent days, I have met with our soldiers at their bases, at the assembly points, in the north and in the south. We have an amazing army, with wonderful and heroic soldiers: Jews and non-Jews, secular and religious, left and right. They are all imbued with a fighting spirit the likes of which I have never seen, including a willingness to fight with strength and force against an enemy whose brutality and criminality are unparalleled.

They are longing to recompense the murderers for the horrific acts they perpetrated on our children, our women, our parents and our friends. They are committed to eradicating this evil from the world, for our existence, and I add, for the good of all humanity. The entire people, and the leadership of the people, embrace them and believe in them. 'Remember what Amalek did to you' (Deuteronomy 25:17). We remember and we fight.

Our brave soldiers who are now in Gaza, around Gaza and in the other sectors throughout the country, join a chain of heroes of Israel that has continued for over 3,000 years, from Joshua, Judah Maccabee and Bar Kochba, and up to the heroes of 1948, the Six Day War, the Yom Kippur War and Israel's other wars. Our heroic soldiers have one supreme goal: To destroy the murderous enemy and ensure our existence in our land. We have always said 'Never again'. 'Never again' is now.

I also met today with the families of the captives and with bereaved parents. My heart was broken. I reiterated to them: At every stage up to now and at every stage from now, we will exhaust every possibility to bring our brothers and sisters back to their families. Their abduction was a crime against humanity. Whoever dares to accuse our soldiers of war crimes are hypocritical liars who lack so much as one drop of morality. The IDF is the most moral army in the world. The IDF does everything to avoid harming non-combatants. I again call on the civilian population to evacuate to a safe area in the southern Gaza Strip.

In contrast, the cynicism of the enemy knows no bounds. He carries out war crimes by using civilians as human shields, by using hospitals as terrorist command centers and to supply fuel to its war machine. Many in the world understand very well what we have claimed through the years: Israel is fighting not only its war, but a war for all of humanity – the war of humanity against barbarism. Our allies in the West and our partners in the Arab world, understand today that if Israel does not win, they will be next in line in the axis of evil's campaign of conquest and murder.

Since the start of the war, we have succeeded in securing broad international support which includes leaders from the US and Europe, led by President Biden, together with the French President, the British Prime Minister, the Italian Prime Minister, the German Chancellor, and the leaders of the Netherlands, Greece, Cyprus and from other countries as well. They came to us in wartime and brought one clear message: We not only support you – we hope for your victory. We welcome this. We will stand alone but it is good to stand together because we have no other choice.

We also want to clarify that there is one thing that must be underscored: There are moments in which a nation faces two possibilities: To do or die. We now face that test and I have no doubt how it will end: We will be the victors. We will do and we will be the victors.

In the first weeks of the war, we pounded the enemy with a massive aerial campaign, the force of which has been increasing in recent days, in order to assist our forces in making a safer ground incursion. We have eliminated countless terrorists, including arch-terrorists, and we have destroyed many terrorist command posts and infrastructure. We are only just getting started.

The war inside the Gaza Strip will be long and difficult – and we are ready for it. This our second war of independence. We will fight to defend our homeland. We will fight and not retreat. We will fight on land, at sea and in the air. We will destroy the enemy above ground and below ground. We will fight and we will win.

This will be a victory of good over evil, of light over darkness, of life over death. In this war we will stand steadfast, more united than ever, certain in the justice of our cause. This is the mission of our lives. This is also the mission of my life.

On your behalf, on behalf of all of us, I pray for the wellbeing of our soldiers: 'May G-d make the enemies who rise against us be struck down before them! May He subdue our enemies under them and crown them with deliverance and victory.'

Together we will fight and together we will win"
28.10.2023,"Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu met today, together with his wife Sara, at the Kirya in Tel Aviv, for the second time with representatives of the families of the captives in Gaza.

Prime Minister Netanyahu promised the representatives that he would do everything possible to bring about the release of all of the captives and said that this was one of the goals of the war. His wife Sara embraced the families and expressed her support for them at this unbearable time for each one of them in particular and for the state as a whole.

Prime Minister Netanyahu to the families' representatives:

""I must tell you before we go into a few more limited details, that not only is this effort unceasing, it is continuing and will do so vigorously. We will utilize and exhaust every possibility to bring them home.

This is before and after the incursion, and the effort is to utilize our capabilities. It is an integral part of the goals for the operations as we have defined them. This is not mere lip service.

An effort is being made. I am not certain if people understand the extent to which it is being conducted and to what scope, including directives to the forces on the ground and on a very extensive global and local scale, and this is going on all the time.

I could say what the key is, it is the degree of pressure. The greater the pressure, the greater the chances"
26.10.2023,"Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, today, visited the Tekuma* Authority in Yavne, which is responsible for carrying out the national mission of rebuilding, strengthening and developing the communities in the area adjacent to the Gaza Strip, which were significantly harmed in the murderous terrorist assault by Hamas on 7 October.

At the start of the visit, the Prime Minister was briefed by Tekuma Director Moshe Edri on the activity and functions of the Authority, and the cooperation with the various Government ministries. Prime Minister was also shown the various stages of the reconstruction process in the immediate, intermediate and long terms. Director Edri shared with the Prime Minister the feelings of the council heads and residents, and the urgency in providing quick and efficient attention.

Prime Minister Netanyahu visited the Authority building and met the teams working on construction and on rehabilitating the area in various fields including education, social services, health, housing, agriculture, infrastructure and reviving business activity. The Prime Minister was also briefed on the actions that have been carried out since the Authority was established last Thursday, including a meeting with local council and community leaders, and the allocation of preliminary cash advances worth NIS 51 million to the communities that were severely damaged. Director Edri told the Prime Minister that additional funds would be transferred in the coming days.

Prime Minister Netanyahu:

""We are going to pass the 'Tekuma District' law. This law will – first of all – provide funds, so you will not have to go with an outstretched hand to some raised fist, rather there will simply be a lot of money for this reconstruction as quickly as possible.

Second, cutting bureaucracy. All of these bureaucratic processes will be cut so that things may be carried out much more quickly.

Third, is hope. Hope is built on one important principle and that is security. We need to smash Hamas so that it will be safe for people to return.

In the final stage, we will be able to build and expand, and make this area very prosperous and safe. I would say that there is a primary national, even historical, mission here.

I would like to thank you for what you are doing; it is very important. Some of you also come from these communities. Well done.""

Also participating in the visit were the Prime Minister's Chief of Staff, the Prime Minister's Office (PMO) Director General, the Director of the National Economic Council and the PMO Deputy Director General for Planning and Development"
25.10.2023,"Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, today, at the Kirya in Tel Aviv, met with Austrian Chancellor Karl Nehammer.

 Prime Minister Netanyahu at the start of the meeting:

 ""I thank you, Chancellor, for coming here. You’ve expressed unqualified support for Israel. It’s our darkest hour, and your support is important. Because this is a battle of civilization against barbarism, and Israel is fighting the battle for civilization, which I know you support. Thank you for coming here.

 Austrian Chancellor Nehammer:

 ""Absolutely. That’s the reason why I am here, also as my Prime Minister colleague from the Czech Republic, because we stand on the side of Israel. We have the same and share the same values. And the joint fight against terrorism is now more important than ever.""

 Prime Minister Netanyahu:

 ""This is barbarism. It’s the worst atrocities committed against the Jewish people since the Holocaust. It’s worse than ISIS.""

 Austrian Chancellor Nehammer:

 ""Yes. It’s unbelievable. So we have to fight"
25.10.2023,"Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, today, at the Kirya in Tel Aviv, met with Czech Republic Prime Minister Petr Fiala.
 
Prime Minister Netanyahu at the start of the meeting:

""I’m very pleased to welcome you here. Czech Republic has been very, very strongly supportive of Israel throughout good times and dark times. This is our darkest hour and I appreciate the fact that you are standing here. Your support is invaluable and I welcome you to Israel.

I always say that standing with Israel, there’s only one thing better than that and that is standing in Israel. And that’s what you’re doing. Thank you.""

Czech Prime Minister Fiala:

"" Thank you, Mr. Prime Minister. I came here in this difficult time to express our clear support and solidarity with Israel.

We had a plan to meet in Prague at October the 8th, but one day before, Hamas and Palestinian terrorist organizations started a barbaric terror. October 7th was the most tragic day for Israel and Jewish people for decades. One Czech citizen was also a victim of this act of terror.

The pictures and videos which we have seen are shocking, really shocking. These acts of violence have no place in our world. I want to make it very clear: Czech Republic stands with Israel, now and ever. And like 75 years ago, you can count on our voice and support.

I’m glad that Czech companies immediately supplied basic military equipment to Israel, specifically it was 3,000 pieces of ballistic plates and we have option to send more.

Israel has an absolute right to defend itself. Terrorists still have more than 200 hostages. I feel deeply with all families. The international community must push for their unconditional release.

Tomorrow I am going to Brussels to a European Council meeting, and my goal is to ensure that the Council confirms the strong support for Israel and its right to defend itself. Hamas is our common enemy. We must ensure that it is isolated. And it is on EU terror list for years and now we must act.

So, dear Prime Minister, Israel can count on Czech Republic. We are with you as we always have been"
24.10.2023,"Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visited the IDF Yahalom Unit (special unit of the Combat Engineering Corps), at the IDF Immanuel Base, and was accompanied by the Head of Ground Forces Command, Maj.-Gen. Tamir Yadai and IDF Chief Engineering Officer Brig.-Gen. Ido Mizrachi.

At the start of the visit, Prime Minister Netanyahu was briefed by Yahalom Unit commander Col. A on the activity of the unit since the start of the fighting and on its readiness for the future. The Prime Minister was also shown the elite unit's special capabilities, including underground activity and explosives.

The Prime Minister was also shown quantities of munitions that Hamas terrorists brought into the country as part of their campaign of murder, and which were seized by the Yahalom Unit and given over to the National Center for Neutralizing Ammunition which it operates. 

Prime Minister Netanyahu to the soldiers: 

""I want to tell you where we are at the moment. We are striking the enemy with great force. Yesterday, in our attacks in Gaza, we struck the enemy the harshest blow they have taken in a single day. We killed dozens of terrorists, possibly even more. At this very moment, we are clarifying the exact magnitude of the strike. However, we also know that even as we are active in additional sectors in the north, we are hitting whoever tries to attack us, in Judea and Samaria as well.

We stand before the next stage, it is coming. You know it and you are part of it; you are part of the vanguard. I greatly appreciate what you know how to do, your fighting spirit, your readiness to save our country from these animals, and I am certain that you will succeed.

We have only one mission – to smash Hamas. We will not stop until we complete it, with your help. I rely on you; the people of Israel rely on you. I am proud of you and I salute you"
24.10.2023,"Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to French President Emmanuel Macron: ""Hamas barbarism not only threatens the Jews, it threatens the Middle East, it threatens the region, it threatens Europe, it threatens the world. Hamas is the test case of civilization against barbarism.""

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, today, at the Prime Minister's Office in Jerusalem, met with French President Emmanuel Macron.

Prime Minister Netanyahu:

""President Macron, Emmanuel, thank you for coming to Israel. Your support, that of your delegation, is highly appreciated.

On October 7th, Hamas waged war on Israel. It was the worst terrorist attack the world has known since 9/11, but for Israel proportionately, it was like twenty 9/11s.

It was the worst act of antisemitic violence since the Holocaust. I described to you some of the horrors. It’s impossible to describe all of them. But like Anne Frank, Jewish children hid in attics from these monsters and they were found and butchered. As in Babi Yar, Jews were machine-gunned in killing pits. Hamas butchered. Hamas beheaded. Hamas burned babies alive. Hamas raped. Hamas kidnapped hostages—over 200: babies, children, elderly, Holocaust survivors.

We are in a war between barbarism and civilization. Chancellor Scholz, who visited Israel, said that Hamas are the new Nazis. And as in the Second World War, when the Allies fully supported the French anti-Nazi Resistance, today the international community is uniting in support of Israel. For Hamas barbarism not only threatens the Jews, it threatens the Middle East, it threatens the region, it threatens Europe, it threatens the world. Hamas is the test case of civilization against barbarism.

Mr. President, you and the French people have known the horror of terrorism. You experienced it in Nice, in Lyon and Paris. You refused to tolerate this threat. And the people of Israel refuse to have ISIS in a terror enclave on its border.

I have to explain. This is not an enclave of ISIS thousands of kilometers away from Europe. It’s ISIS in the suburbs of Paris. You can drive 20 minutes and you reach the suburbs of Paris and you have ISIS there.

We cannot live like that. Nobody can live like that. So we are doing everything we need to do to destroy Hamas in Gaza. We will dismantle its terror machine. We will dismantle its political structure. We will make every effort to release our hostages. And we will make every effort to keep Palestinian civilians out of harm’s way.

It’s important to understand: Hamas is committing a double war crime. It’s not only murdering our civilians, targeting our civilians, doing unspeakable war crimes; they’re also hiding behind civilians, their own civilians. We asked the people of Gaza to leave, to go to a safe zone in the south where we’re enabling humanitarian aid to reach them; Hamas is putting checkpoints with people with guns to prevent Palestinians from leaving the war zone.

Hamas is responsible for civilian casualties, but we will do every effort to avoid them and to fight this war as speedily and as rapidly as we can. But it could be a long war.

When this is over, the people of Israel will rebuild their communities and the people of Gaza will no longer live under Hamas tyranny. But first, there is one condition, one condition for anything that could happen and the good things that could happen once this war is over, and that condition is that Hamas must be destroyed.

I thank you, Emmanuel, for coming here to Israel, for standing with Israel, for standing with us in Israel and expressing your support.

We rely on your continued support as this important battle for our future, our common future, proceeds till victory. Thank you.""

French President Macron:

""Mr. Prime Minister, Dear Bibi, thank you for your words, and I want to thank you for the discussion we had together in tête-à-tête and with our delegation. I'm here to express our support, our solidarity, and our support for today, tomorrow, in all different fields of this battle against terrorism.

If you allow me I will say a few words in French.

[French]

I want to thank you Mr. Prime Minister, not just for your time, but because I'm lucid about the fact that this fight against terrorism is obviously matter of existence for Israel. But it's matter of existence for all of us. This is why we discussed together, and I just reminded this issue. But I consider that this is an international coalition in order to fight against this terrorist group that we have to build.

I just reminded my people in my language what we discussed. About fight against terrorism, humanitarian action, rules to be respected, but as well, political process. And obviously I warned against any escalation, and I warned Hezbollah and other regimes not to be part of what's happening.

We had a very precise discussion and I want to thank you for that. Now we will follow up this discussion in the coming hours in order to see what we can improve in the coming days, but I'm sure in the coming weeks and months.

I know how committed you are. Let me express again my solidarity, my friendship, and the fact that France stands with you in this awful terrorist acts you had to experience. We are with your people.""

Prime Minister Netanyahu:

""Thank you, Emmanuel. 

Since you mentioned the regional aspects, let me say a word about that. There is a battle here between the Axis of Evil, led by Iran, Hezbollah, Hamas, Houthis, their minions who are fighting to bring back the Middle East [sic], the world to the early Middle Ages, with that kind of barbarism, with bondage, with slaughter, with murder. And there is the axis of the Free World and the moderates who want to bring the world to the progress and prosperity of the 21st century. This is the battle. It’s engaged now.

The test for the West and for civilization is Hamas. If Hamas emerges victorious, we will all lose. Europe will be in danger. Everyone will be in danger. Civilization will be in danger. If Hamas loses and is defeated, then the forces of civilization win.

That is why this battle is not merely our own. It’s Europe’s battle. It’s America’s battle it’s civilization’s battle. It’s the battle for the heart and soul and the future of the Middle East and the Arab world. I think many understand that, but there’s no going around the fact that we must have a decisive victory against Hamas. 

If Hezbollah makes the mistake of joining this war in a significant way, it will regret it. They will long for the Second Lebanon War, which they regretted. Because they’re embedding themselves, like Hamas, in the civilian population in Lebanon, we will have to take action against them. And the devastation against Hezbollah will be unimaginable. 

So I hope they heed your warning, our warning, the warning of the United States not to do so. But if they will, they’ll suffer horrible consequences. We have to join together and win. The forces of civilization, progress, have to win. That goes through the defeat of Hamas. 

I thank you, Emmanuel, for everything you said. Thank you for coming here and standing with us"

I always say that the best thing about standing with Israel is standing in Israel in Israel. And you're doing that. I appreciate the solidarity of you, your government, the people of Greece, at this darkest hour.

It's a battle against civilization. It's civilization against barbarism. We're on the side of civilization. We have to unite, all together, against Hamas, which is ISIS.""

Greek Prime Minister Mitsotakis:

""Thank you. Thank you so much, Prime Minister. Dear Bibi, I come here not just as an ally, but as a true friend. What happened was truly horrible and we from the very first moment defended and supported the right of Israel to defend itself in line with international law. And we drew a very clear distinction between Hamas and the Palestinian people.

We will continue to be able to support you and to hope that whatever happens, happens without too much of a humanitarian cost. But you can count on our support and our help"
22.10.2023,"Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visited the IDF Commando Brigade in the north. He was briefed by its commander, Col. Omer Cohen, and Malan unit commander, Lt.-Col. A, on the Brigade soldiers' fierce combat, during which they eliminated hundreds of terrorists and saved dozens of civilians, until achieving operational control of the area adjacent to the Gaza Strip in the first days of fighting. The Prime Minister was also briefed on the deployment of the Brigade in all sectors as well as on its operations in the southern and northern sectors and in Judea and Samaria.

At the conclusion of the visit, the commander and soldiers of the Brigade made it clear to Prime Minister Netanyahu that they were ready to continue fighting and defeat the enemy in all sectors thanks to their training and combat proficiency and the Brigade's weaponry and capabilities.

Prime Minister Netanyahu:

""You fought with exemplary heroism in Gaza. Your stories are very inspirational. I know that you lost comrades; this is very, very difficult but we are fighting for our lives, for our home. This is no exaggeration – this is war.

We are now in a double battle. One battle is to block them here. The second battle is to win a crushing victory that will erase Hamas. To this end, for the moment you are holding the line here. But there in the south as well, your comrades are ready for any mission. You are ready here and they are ready there.

What you are doing here and what I heard just now from your commanders is incredibly important. You are killing Hezbollah members who are trying to attack our front line. At the moment, I cannot tell you if Hezbollah will decide to fully enter the war or not. If Hezbollah decides to enter the war, it will wish for the Second Lebanon War; it will be making the mistake of its life. We will strike it with a force that it cannot even imagine, that will be destructive for it and for the Lebanese state. However, we are ready for any scenario. You are ready for any scenario.

You have shown heroism, fighting spirit and determination. With these, we will win a complete victory. I want to salute you. You are heroes. You are lions; you have fought – and you will fight – like lions. The entire people of Israel are behind you; the entire people of Israel salute you.""

21.10.2023,"Prime Minister Meloni, Giorgia,
 
Thank you for coming here and for standing with Israel. We always say there's one thing better than standing with Israel. It's standing in Israel. We welcome you for coming here. This is our darkest hour. 
 
We have to defeat this barbarism. This is a battle between the forces of civilization and really, monstrous barbarians who murdered, mutilated, raped, beheaded, burned innocent people, babies, grandmothers.
This is a test, a test of civilization and we will win. And we expect all the countries that lined up to fight ISIS, to line up and fight Hamas, because Hamas is the new ISIS. 
 
So, thank you for coming here.""
 
Italian Prime Minister Meloni:
 
Prime Minister, I'm happy to be here. I felt it was very important to come personally to bring the solidarity of the Italian government and the Italian people, and to tell you that we saw images that were incredible about what happened two weeks ago. That showed something more than simply, well, a war. They showed somebody who wants to cancel Jewish people from this region. And it is up to antisemitism. That is something we have to fight yesterday and today.
 
We defend the right of Israel existing, of defending itself, security for its people. And we absolutely understand that terrorism has to be fought. We believe and we think that you are able to do that in the best way, for we are different from those terrorists"
22.10.2023,"Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, this evening, at the Kirya in Tel Aviv, met with Cypriot President Nikos Christodoulides.

Prime Minister Netanyahu, at the start of the meeting:

""Nikos, my friend, you are coming at a time which I can say is our darkest hour.

It is a battle of civilization against barbarism. What we saw in Gaza, along our communities is beyond description. It is savagery that is the worst that we've seen against Jewish people since the Holocaust. They murdered children in front of their parents and parents in front of their children, burned people alive, decapitated people, raped and murdered women. Babies who were hiding in the attic, they killed them. Today we discovered a grandmother in a secret attic holding her grandchild. They murdered both of them.

This is savagery on a scale that is unimaginable. And our battle against Hamas is the battle of civilization against barbarism.

Hamas, I said in the UN ten years ago, almost a decade ago, Hamas is ISIS. People didn’t believe me. Now they know it's actually worse than ISIS, as President Biden said, and Chancellor Scholz said that Hamas are the new Nazis.

The world united to fight the Nazis. The civilized world united to fight ISIS. And now, the civilized world should stand with us as we defeat ISIS. This is our goal.

Thank you for your strong support from the start"
19.10.2023,"I am here with Golani soldiers from all parts of the country. They have fought like lions and will fight like lions.

We are going to win with full force.

The entire people of Israel are behind you and we will deal harsh blows to our enemies in order to achieve victory. To victory!""

Prime Minister Netanyahu spoke with the soldiers and heard about their fighting spirit. He also heard from the Head of IDF Ground Forces Maj.-Gen. Tamir Yadai about the difficult battles the soldiers have been involved in since the onset of combat and about their future deployment"
19.10.2023,"Prime Minister Sunak, Rishi, I want to thank you for your solidarity, your clear unwavering support from the minute this war began. I think the fact that you came to Israel tells us a lot.

I said to President Biden yesterday, if there is one thing more heartwarming than standing with Israel it’s standing in Israel. And the fact that you came here to do that is a very strong statement of support which we deeply appreciate it.
 
Chancellor Scholz, who also visited here called Hamas the new Nazis. He was right. You fought the Nazis 80 years ago resolutely and the entire world supported your action. President Biden called Hamas worse than ISIS. He’s right too.

Hamas are the new Nazis, they’re the new ISIS, and we have to fight them together just as the civilized world united to fight the Nazis and united to fight Hamas, it must together now stand with Israel as we fight and defeat Hamas.

This is not merely our battle. It’s the battle of the entire civilized world. It’s the battle of Israel, it’s the battle of the moderate Arab countries, it’s the battle of Western civilization, the battle of the free world, the battle for the future.

We have here two forces. One is an axis of evil, led by Iran through Hezbollah, Hamas and others that want to bring back the Middle East to the Middle Ages, to an age of bondage and war and slavery and annihilation. 

The other force are the forces of progress and humanity that want to push the Middle East into a world of peace and prosperity. We were on the cusp of expanding that peace and destroying that move was one of the reasons why this action was taken. We have to resist it and we have to win.

Above all, we have to win. 

We have to release the hostages. You have nationals. I understand, I know you do, that they have our children, babies, women, elderly, Holocaust survivors and your nationals. And we have to work together in every way possible, and we’re doing that, to get them back.

I appreciate the fact that you also sent some military forces into the region. We discussed practical cooperation on many fronts and I value that very much.
 
Eighty years ago, eighty years ago, Prime Minister, the civilized world stood with you in your darkest hour. This is our darkest hour. It’s the world’s darkest hour. We need to stand together and we will win. And this is why I support and value your support. And the fact that you’re here, we must win together.

That means it’s going to be a long war and we’ll need your continuous support, continuous support. There will be ups and downs. There will be difficulties. The people here are united, they’re prepared to take the necessary action. I’ve never seen the people of Israel as united, more united as they are now. But we need that unity across the board and continuous support as we prosecute and win this just war against the modern barbarians, the worst monsters on the planet. Thank you, Rishi, for coming here.""

British Prime Minister Sunak:

""Prime Minister, thank you for your warm words and for welcoming me to Israel. I’m just sorry to be here in such terrible circumstances. 

In the last two weeks, this country has gone through something that no country, no people, should have to endure, least of all Israel which has lived through some of the most awful scenes, the specter of violence and terrorism every day of its existence.

I want to share the deep condolences of the British people and stress that we absolutely support Israel’s right to defend itself in line with international law, to go after Hamas, to take back hostages, deter further incursions and to strengthen your security for the long-term.
 
Now, I know that you are taking every precaution to harming civilians in direct contrast to the terrorists of Hamas which seek to put civilians in harm’s way. 

But I also want to thank you for the support your government has given to the families of British nationals caught up in this horror, including your efforts to release the hostages, secure their release. And I know that we will continue to cooperate, particularly with regard to British nationals that are involved. 

We have seen the scenes over the past day that have shocked all of us, particularly at the hospital. And we mourn the loss of every innocent life, civilians of every faith, every nationality, who have been killed. And we also recognize that the Palestinian people are victims of Hamas too.

That is why I welcome your decision yesterday that you took to ensure that routes into Gaza will be open for humanitarian aid to enter. I’m glad that you made that decision. We will support it. We are increasing our aid to the region and we will look to get more support to people as quickly as we can.

The last thing for me to close on is this. You described this as Israel’s darkest hour. I am proud to stand here with you in Israel’s darkest hour. As your friend, we will stand with you in solidarity, we will stand with your people and we also want you to win"
18.10.2023,"Citizens of Israel, I would like to update you on several matters from my meeting with US President Joe Biden. Yesterday evening, before the US President left for Israel, I presented him with concrete proof that it was Islamic Jihad, and not the IDF, that had fired the missile that struck the hospital in Gaza. I directed our National Public Diplomacy Directorate and the IDF to disseminate this proof, and today the world knows the truth. It will also hear this from the UN Security Council.

This is the first time that a US President has come to Israel in wartime. I spoke with him about the horrors that we face, about the terrible pain of bereavement that has affected all of us, and about the daring of our citizens and the unity among us.

During the visit today, we achieved something of utmost importance that greatly contributes to our security: Immense security assistance for the State of Israel of an unprecedented scope, including assistance that further strengthens our war capabilities.

Regarding the captives, I clarified three things for President Biden: First, I demanded the return of our captives, and we are working together for their return in every possible way. Second, until their return, we demand Red Cross visits for our captives. Third, we will not allow humanitarian assistance in the form of food and medicines from our territory to the Gaza Strip.

President Biden came here with not just comforting and moving words, which touched the heart of the entire nation, but with deeds: In our meeting today, we agreed on actions that will ensure the continuation of our just war. We agreed on cooperation that will change the equation in all sectors, and will assist us in achieving our war aims.

Citizens of Israel, my brothers and sisters, the people of Israel live – and the people of Israel will win"
18.10.2023,"Sara Netanyahu, today, paid a condolence call on the Moreno family, which lost its son Itay, a soldier in the Maglan unit, who fell in battle with terrorists at Zikim.

Itay fell 17 years after his uncle, Lt.-Col. Emmanuel Moreno, fell. Thirty minutes before the battle at Zikim, Itay met his father Moshe, who came to the south to volunteer.

Mrs. Netanyahu embraced, and offered her support to, the family and heard from them stories about Itay's great heroism and his important contribution to Israel's security.

Sara Netanyahu sat with the parents, Moshe and Tami, the grandparents, Moshe and Margalit, and grandparents Ilan and Sylvia Moreno, who lost their grandson Itay several days ago and their son Emmanuel 17 years ago.

Mrs. Netanyahu then sat privately with the young widow, Gal, embraced her and offered her support, and heard about her husband, and the difficulties alongside her faith in the justice of our cause.
 
Sara Netanyahu:

""I met with an exemplary family, a family of heroes. Our common destiny binds our two families. On behalf of all citizens of Israel, I embraced them from the depths of my heart. We will always remember Itay, who was a hero of Israel just like his uncle Emmanuel.

I know that Emmanuel was raised on the story of the heroism of Yoni Netanyahu, and Itay was raised on the story of the heroism of Emmanuel Moreno. This is the chain of the generations and the heroism of our people, since the days of Joshua and the Maccabees. I know that many soldiers will study the story of Itay's heroism.

The people of Israel embrace you. The people of Israel will always be with you. May their memories be blessed and enshrined in our hearts forever"
18.10.2023,"Prime Minister Netanyahu to US President Biden: ""The road to victory will be long and hard, but united in purpose and with a deep sense of justice and the unbreakable spirit of our soldiers and our people, Israel will prevail.""

 US President Biden to Prime Minister Netanyahu: ""The United States stands with you in defense of that freedom, in pursuit of that justice and in support of that peace. Today, tomorrow and always.""

Prime Minister Netanyahu:

""Mr. President, you are meeting with our united war cabinet, united in resolve to lead Israel to victory.

This will be a different kind of war because Hamas is a different kind of enemy. While Israel seeks to minimize civilian casualties, Hamas seeks to maximize civilian casualties. Hamas wants to kill as many Israelis as possible and has no regard whatsoever to Palestinian lives. Every day, they perpetrate a double war crime: targeting our civilians while hiding behind their civilians, embedding themselves in the civilian population and using them as human shields.

We’ve seen the cost of this terrible double war crime against humanity that Hamas is perpetrating in the last 11 days. As Israel legitimately targets terrorists, civilians are unfortunately harmed. Hamas is responsible and should be held accountable for all civilian casualties.

We saw the cost of this terrible war crime yesterday when a rocket fired by Palestinian terrorists misfired and landed on a Palestinian hospital. The entire world was rightfully outraged but this outrage should be directed not at Israel but at the terrorists.

As we proceed in this war, Israel will do everything it can to keep civilians out of harm’s way. We’ve asked them and we will continue to ask them to move to safer areas.

We will continue to work with you, Mr. President, to assure that the minimum requirements are met and we will continue to work together to get our hostages out.

Mr. President, the road to victory will be long and hard, but united in purpose and with a deep sense of justice and the unbreakable spirit of our soldiers and our people, Israel will prevail.

Thank you, Mr. President.""

US President Biden:

""Well, thank you, Mr. Prime Minister. In the wake of Hamas’ appalling terrorist assault, it was brutal, inhumane, almost beyond belief what they did, this cabinet came together standing strong, standing united.

And I want you to know you are not alone. As I emphasized earlier, we will continue to have Israel’s back as you work to defend your people. We will continue to work with you and partners across the region to prevent more tragedy to innocent civilians.

Seventy-five years ago, your founders declared that this nation would be one based on freedom, justice and peace. Based on freedom, justice and peace. The United States stands with you in defense of that freedom, in pursuit of that justice and in support of that peace. Today, tomorrow and always. We promise you"
18.10.2023,"Mr. President, Joe,
I want to thank you for coming here today and for the unequivocal support you have given Israel during these trying times. A support that reflects the overwhelming will of the American people. I have seen your support every day in the depth and breath of cooperation that we have had since the beginning of this war. A level of cooperation that is truly unprecedented in the history of the great alliance between our two nations. We see that support in your steadfast commitment to provide Israel with the tools we need to defend ourselves, we see that support in the clear message you send our enemies not to test our resolve and in the two American carrier battle groups you sent into the region to back up those words with action. 

But above all, Mr. President, the world sees that support in the moral clarity that you have demonstrated from the moment that Israel was attacked. You have rightly drawn a clear line between the forces of civilization and the forces of barbarism. You described what Hamas did as sheer evil. It is exactly that. Hamas murdered children in front of their parents and parents in front of their children, they burnt people alive, they raped and murdered women, they beheaded soldiers, they searched for the secret hiding places where parents hid their children. Just imagine, Mr. President, the fear and the panic of those little children in their last moments as the monsters discovered, found out their secret hiding places. Hamas kidnapped women, children, elderly, Holocaust survivors. I know you share our outrage on this and I know you share our determination to bring these people back. 

On October 7th, Hamas murdered 1,400 Israelis. Maybe more. This is in a country of fewer than 10 million people. This would be equivalent to over 50,000 Americans murdered in a single day. That’s twenty 9/11s. That is why October 7th is another day that will live in infamy. 

Mr. President, you rightly said that Hamas is worse than ISIS. The German Chancellor, who visited here yesterday, said that Hamas were the new Nazis. You’re both right. And just as the civilized world united to defeat the Nazis and united to defeat ISIS, the civilized world must unite to defeat Hamas. I can assure you, Mr. President, Israel is united to defeat Hamas and we will defeat Hamas and remove this terrible threat from our lives. The forces of civilization will prevail, for our sake, for your sake, for peace and security in our region and in the world.
Mr. President, for the people of Israel there is only one thing better than having a true friend like you standing with Israel and that is having you standing in Israel. Your visit here is the first visit of an American president in Israel in a time of war. It is deeply, deeply moving. It speaks to the depth of your personal commitment to Israel. It speaks to the depth of your personal commitment to the future of the Jewish people and the one and only Jewish state. So I know I speak for all the people of Israel when I say thank you, Mr. President. Thank you for standing with Israel today, tomorrow and always"
17.10.2023,"Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, today , at the Kirya in Tel Aviv, held a private meeting with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz. The leaders then issued statements to the media.

Prime Minister Netanyahu:

""Chancellor Scholz, thank you for coming to Israel. Thank you for your solidarity with Israel, you, the government of Germany, the people of Germany, in these trying times.

Eighty years ago, our people experienced the worst savagery in the history of humanity with the Nazi crimes against the Jewish people on the soil of Germany and Europe. I must tell you, my friend, that the savagery we witnessed perpetrated by the Hamas murderers coming out of Gaza were the worst crimes committed against Jews since the Holocaust: the decapitation of people, the shooting of little children with bound hands, the murder of children in front of their parents, the murder of parents in front of their children, the hiding of babies in the attic and the murderers who came to the attic to murder the babies, the rape and murder of women, the abduction of families, the tearing of grandmothers and Holocaust survivors into captivity, the death pits that remind of us of Babi Yar where jeeps surround the depression in the ground where they crowd young people in and they shoot them with machine guns. This is the savagery that we only remember from the Nazi crimes from the Holocaust.

Hamas are the new Nazis. Hamas is ISIS and in some instances, worse than ISIS. And just as the world united to defeat the Nazis, just as the world united to defeat ISIS, the world has to stand united behind Israel to defeat Hamas.

This is a part of an axis of evil: of Iran, Hezbollah and Hamas. Their goal, open goal, is to eradicate the State of Israel. The open goal of Hamas is to kill as many Jews as they could and the only difference is they would have killed every last one of us, murdered every last one of us if they could, they just don’t have the capacity, but they murdered an extraordinary 1,300 citizens which in American terms is many, many, many 9/11s.

 

So obviously we must take action to defeat Hamas to ensure that this doesn’t happen again. But this is not only our battle, it is our common battle. The battle of civilization against barbarism. And if it’s not stopped here, this savagery will reach you very soon and reach the entire world. We have a vested interest, an abiding interest, to make sure that doesn’t happen and it can only be achieved with the solidarity of the civilized world.

 

I hope and I believe that many, many around the world see ISIS for what it is and see Hamas for what it is, which is a reincarnation of ISIS.

 

We appreciate the fact that you came here to stand with us in this battle for the future of civilization.

 

Thank you, Chancellor.""

 

The Prime Minister added:

 

""Thank you, Chancellor. I appreciate all your statements, including your last reference to protecting the Jewish community. We discussed this in our conversation as well.

 

The question of the safety of civilians is something that is raised by Hamas' actions. Hamas is committing a double war crime. Not only is it targeting civilians with unprecedented savagery, it’s hiding by civilians, their own civilians.

We are calling on the civilians to leave Gaza, go south to safe zones and Hamas is preventing them often at gunpoint from doing so. Hamas wants to keep them there as a human shield and prevent the people from leaving and getting out of harm’s way.

It’s important that the entire world understands this. The responsibility for the civilians who are there, both the abducted people and both the people who are kept there at force, the citizens of our country, and the citizens of dozens of countries and the Palestinian civilians themselves, that responsibility sits squarely on the shoulders of the Hamas war criminals.

They’re committing a double war crime: attacking civilians, hiding behind civilians as human shields. The entire world should condemn it and should support Israel in its just war.

Thank you very much, Chancellor"
17.10.2023,"Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, today, visited the IDF General Staff Reconnaissance Unit base in southern Israel where he was briefed by the Unit commander on its activity in the war up until now and on its future operations. The Prime Minister also spoke with the soldiers and consoled them on the loss of their comrades.

Prime Minister Netanyahu:

""The entire country stands behind you, and you stand for each other. I know that together we will do the right thing. It will take time but in the end it is the frontline and the fighting, and this fighting will be conducted with great force in the coming days. I want you to know that we rely on you, believe in you and support you, and I know that you will do the work. Well done"
17.10.2023,"Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, today, at the Prime Minister's Office, met with Romanian Prime Minister Marcel Ciolacu.

The two leaders first held an expanded meeting. Participating from the Israeli side were the Prime Minister's Chief of Staff, the Prime Minister's Office Director General, the Prime Minister's Foreign Policy Adviser and the Israeli Ambassador to Romania. Participating for the Romanian side were the Defense Minister, the Foreign Minister, MP Silviu Vexler and the Romanian Ambassador to Israel.

Prime Minister Netanyahu:

""Mr. Prime Minister, we very much appreciate your coming here to be with the people of Israel. You stand with Israel and you stand in Israel at the time of great turmoil. Romania has already been a friend of Israel but friends are tested in times of need. There is a need now for the support of all the European countries for Israel's just battle against these barbarians, these savages who broke every norm.

They are really the new Nazis. They murdered children, they beheaded young people, they burnt them alive, they raped and murdered women, they kidnapped old people, they murdered little children in front of their families and murdered the parents in front of their children. There was no mercy. There were death pits. There were killings of people who were hiding in attics. This is exactly like Babi Yar. It's as though Anne Frank comes back, the story. The horror is the same horror.

But we have today, unlike the Holocaust, we have a state and an army and a people that can fight back. We are not fighting just our war, we're fighting the war of all civilized countries and all civilized peoples. And just as the civilized world united in fighting the Nazis, united in fighting Daesh, ISIS, then the civilized world should unite behind Israel in fighting and eradicating Hamas.

I appreciate your solidarity in this time for this goal that serves our common civilization. We'll do everything in our power to assist the removal or the exit of your nationals from Gaza to the extent that is possible obviously.

The quest for peace in the Middle East is something we share. Such a peace will only be possible if this caliphate, this Daesh caliphate, is destroyed. Nobody can make peace with Daesh, nobody can make peace with Al Qaida and nobody could make peace with the Nazis. They have to be defeated. Then we have the peace.""

Romanian Prime Minister Ciolacu :

""Mr. Prime Minister, first and foremost, we wanted to show you that friends show their solidarity in practice. This is why Romania is standing with Israel, today, here. Romanian society, Israelis in Romania and the Romanians in Israel are all crying about the situation, the horrible situation that the State of Israel is at as a result of the attack by the terrorist organization Hamas. We express our condolences for the people who lost their lives and unfortunately amongst the injured were also Romanians.

We condemn what has happened in Israel and also the terrorist organization Hamas which is acting the way it's acting with its means to reach its goals in such a savage way.

This is why the Romanian parliament was the first parliament in Europe to have, with both chambers, a commonly agreed statement in support of the State of Israel. This is why Romania is asking for the international community not only to act on the people who are being held hostages by the Hamas terrorist organization.

This is why, in accordance with humanitarian law, I told Prime Minister Netanyahu that Israel is in its full right to defend itself against such atrocities. I'm making an appeal also to the international community, to make sure they can support the opening of human corridors to make sure that the innocent are truly capable of being taken out of that situation"
17.10.2023,"Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, today, at the opening of the Winter Assembly of the 25th Knesset's Second Session :
 
""This is a moment of genuine struggle against those who have risen up against us to destroy us. Our goal is victory – a crushing victory over Hamas, toppling its regime and removing its threat to the State of Israel once and for all.
 
There are many questions about the disaster that befell us ten days ago. We will investigate everything thoroughly. We have already begun to apply immediate lessons. However, now we are focused on one goal: Uniting our forces and storming forward to victory.
 
To this end, determination is required because victory will take time. There will be difficult moments. There will be pitfalls. Sacrifice will be necessary. But we will win because this is our very existence in this region, in which there are many dark forces.
 
Hamas is part of the axis of evil of Iran, Hezbollah and their minions. They seek to destroy the State of Israel and murder us all. They want to return the Middle East to the abyss of the barbaric fanaticism of the Middle Ages, whereas we want to take the Middle East forward to the heights of progress of the 21st century.
 
 We saw this in the horrors that the reprehensible murderers perpetrated in Kibbutz Be'eri, in Kfar Aza, in the other communities of the area adjacent to the Gaza Strip, and in the killing field of young people at a festival in Re'im.
 
Many people around the world now understand who stands against Israel. They understand that Hamas is ISIS. They understand that Hamas is the new version of Nazism. Just as the world united to defeat the Nazis and ISIS, so too will it unite to defeat Hamas.
 
I tell our friends in the enlightened world: Our war is also your war. If we do not stand together in a united front, it will reach you as well.
 
We have a message for Iran and Hezbollah: Do not test us in the north. Do not repeat your previous mistake because the price you will pay will be much worse.
 
President Biden told you in English: 'Don’t do it.' I tell you in Hebrew: Be careful.
 
We have gone to war. We will win. We will not stop until victory"

""Citizens of Israel, Shabbat Shalom.

Shabbat shalom to our forces deployed across the country who are celebrating the Sabbath in the field, far from home.

Today, we all understand that we are fighting for our home. And we are all fighting tooth and nail: soldiers, police officers, citizens, security forces, health personnel and rescue teams — and Israel's citizens, with your extraordinary volunteering spiring that has touched the entire world.

We are all mobilized, we are all united. Stories of the heroic acts of our people in these dark days of pain and grief, of that cursed Saturday, will be told for years to come. Stories that will become an integral part of the history of Israel.

We will never forget the horrific acts perpetrated against us by our enemies.

I spoke today with bereaved families and families whose loved ones are still unaccounted for. Their world has collapsed. I know.

We will never forget the horrific acts perpetrated by our enemies, and we will never forgive. We will not allow the world, or anyone, to forget these horrors, the likes of which the Jewish people have not endured in decades.

We are pounding our enemies with unprecedented force, and I stress, this is only the beginning. Our enemies have only just begun to pay the price. I will not detail our plans, but I tell you, this is only the beginning.

In my phone calls with President Biden and other world leaders, and through many other efforts, we are securing vast international support for Israel. Earlier today I met with the US secretary of state. We are ensuring that the war will continue through munitions and weapons that are en route to Israel.

We will obliterate Hamas, we will triumph. It might take time, but we will end this war stronger than ever. ""May the Almighty cause the enemies who rise up against us to be struck down before them.""

""I'm very happy to see you today. I'm very appreciative of the strong stance of the President, you, Secretary Blinken, the American people and the American government.

Hamas is ISIS, and I think what you said and in many ways the President has said, in many ways Hamas is worse than ISIS. And just as the entire civilized world united to fight ISIS, the united civilized world has to unite to help us fight Hamas. I know that you stand with us and I appreciate it mightily.""

US Secretary of Defense Austin:

""We're with you, Mr. Prime Minister. As the President said, we have your back. And it's an awful week. Disgusting acts by this terrorist group. And as you know, I was the guy that initially put the ISIS campaign together. And I know a lot about ISIS, and this is worse than what I saw with ISIS. We do stand with you, Mr. Prime Minister"
12.10.2023,"Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, at the Knesset this evening :

""I have just come from the IDF 98th Division. This is one of the IDF elite units. On the way, on the road leading to the base, I saw a very long row of cars, not on the road but on the shoulders. The cars were parked there by the reservists, many of whom were not even called up, they called themselves up. 130% turnout, the officer responsible told me. I went into the base, to the small and crowded command center, with screens featuring maps of the Gaza Strip.

I met there with the division commander, who had fire in his eyes, level-headedness and a burning fighting spirit together. He and his officers were sitting there and they told me what they were going through. They reported to the base, geared up, went out immediately, some in their private cars. They reached the communities in the area around the Gaza Strip, were hit, their comrades fell but they continued to fight. More of their comrades fell but they continued to fight. They stormed the enemy, eliminated them but sometimes were eliminated. The stories of their heroism are simply amazing.

From the depths of our hearts, we embrace the families who have lost loved ones, the families of the victims, of the fallen, of the murdered and, of course, the families of the abducted. The pain is so great that sometimes it seems that it is too heavy to bear and the grief is also very heavy. It is felt in every home. To all of the families, we send a loving embrace and heartfelt support. I receive regular updates from the person I appointed to be responsible on the issue of the abductees, Brig.-Gen. (Ret.) Gal Hirsch, who is in constant contact with the families. We will not slacken in the effort to bring them back home. At the same time, we are united in the same great determination against the abhorrent and murderous enemy.

Our marvelous soldiers, conscripts and reservists, came out in vast numbers, many from overseas in packed planes because they understand that this is the moment of truth. This truly is a war over home and it must end with one thing – complete victory and the smashing and elimination of Hamas.

Hamas is ISIS and the world that was outraged by ISIS and Al-Qaida after 9/11, formed an international coalition to eliminate this blight. Nobody said 'Let's meet with the representatives of ISIS or Al-Qaida. Nobody said 'Let's give them an office in our country.' Therefore, I said today – there is no such office and if there are countries that maintain their presence, get rid of them, vomit them out of the countries of the world. Vomit them out. Whoever does not do this, sanction them. This is the outward message of the force – the joint stand that I see here in this house, of the leadership of the state and of the people, and it shows our enemies that there is no fragmentation among us, no fissures, no weakness, but rather, the exact opposite.

MKs, citizens of Israel, our people is among the world's oldest. During the thousands of years of our existence we have met countless challenges. We have known suffering. We have known pain more than any other people but we never surrendered. Strength of will and endurance are synonyms for the Jewish people. We will also meet this current test, even though it is almost too difficult to bear. The Shabbat of the 7th of October will be etched as a cursed and dark day in the annals of nations. For us, the Jewish people, it is the most harrowing day since the Holocaust.

But we are not in the Warsaw Ghetto. We are planted deep in the soil of our homeland, the soil of Israel. But the lessons of the Warsaw Ghetto 80 years ago are etched in our national memory. Against the enemy who sought to annihilate, kill and destroy, two competing Jewish organizations, one from the left and one from the right, did not see fit to unite at the moment of truth. Each one insisted on acting alone. The end is well-known. It could be that this end was inevitable but they did not have to reach it that way.

Today, we are facing the same enemy. I have always said and reiterated every time there was a terrorist attack or a murder perpetrated by Hamas or one of the other organizations, I said this when the family was murdered in their car or a bus was blown up, I said – this individual case teaches a general rule. If they could, they would murder all of us. Then the intentions and the enemy were the same. But today, against the enemy, with the ancient command 'Remember what Amalek did to you' ringing in our ears, today we are uniting forces in order to ensure the eternity of Israel.

We have a strong country, a strong government, a strong people and a strong military with a sense of mission and a clinging to that mission, both on the frontline and on the home front. We have faith in our path. We will find these accursed murders, these human beasts, with full force and we will defeat them. We will wipe them off the face of the earth. The time will come when we will rebuild the destroyed communities. We will rebuild the area around the Gaza Strip and we will restore it as a flourishing and prosperous area.

On your behalf, of each and every one of you, I would like to stand by our soldiers, our police officers and those serving in the security, rescue and medical forces, the endless volunteers, and I commend you, wonderful citizens of Israel. You move me, you move us all, with your genuine love for our soldiers and your acts of heroism and loving-kindness.

My friends, difficult days await us but we will not be deterred and we will not give in. The sword of David has been pulled from the scabbard and the bow of Jonathan will not go back. I am certain that from the 'Swords of Iron"" war, we will emerge stronger than ever. As Proverbs 27:17 tells us: 'Iron sharpens iron; so a man sharpens the countenance of his friend.'

Together, with G-d's help, we will ensure the complete victory"
12.10.2023,"Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, today (Thursday, 12 October 2023), visited the IDF 98th Division and heard about the stubborn and daring combat of the paratroop and commando soldiers and officers – conscripts and reservists – in the area around the Gaza Strip, under the command of 98th Division Commander Brig.-Gen. Dan Goldfus, who was among the first commanders who went to the sector and directed the combat from its first minutes until the decision.

The Prime Minister was also briefed by the division commander and his team on the operational plans, the division's tools and capabilities and its operational readiness in all sectors.

Prime Minister Netanyahu:

""I am here with the soldiers and commanders of the 98th Division, lions! Lions! People and lions. They experienced the most difficult ordeal, left everything at home, came here, parked here on the road, kilometers, geared up, went into the field, fought like lions against indescribable horrors and continued to fight, fell, got up, and the spirit I met here is incredible.

I sat here with the senior commanders and now here with the soldiers and commanders. 'Mr. Prime Minister, give us freedom of action.' This is what they are saying. 'Give us the freedom to act. We will crush them and we will ensure the future of the State of Israel. You have the best here, the best.' You are genuine heroes.

I salute you, each one of you, I salute you. Know that the entire people of Israel stands behind you. This is no empty phrase. The people of Israel stand behind you, relies on you and together we will win. Today, after you visit here, you will know how true this is and how correct, and you will know that this is what will be. Thank you all, thank you"

10.10.2023,"Israel is at war.
We didn’t want this war.
It was forced upon us in the most brutal and savage way. 
But though Israel didn’t start this war, Israel will finish it.

Once, the Jewish people were stateless.
Once, the Jewish people were defenseless. 
No longer. 

Hamas will understand that by attacking us, they have made a mistake of historic proportions. We will exact a price that will be remembered by them and Israel’s other enemies for decades to come. 

The savage attacks that Hamas perpetrated against innocent Israelis are mindboggling: slaughtering families in their homes, massacring hundreds of young people at an outdoor festival, kidnapping scores of women, children and elderly, even Holocaust survivors. 

Hamas terrorists bound, burned and executed children.

They are savages.

Hamas is ISIS.

And just as the forces of civilization united to defeat ISIS, the forces of civilization must support Israel in defeating Hamas.

I want to thank President Biden for his unequivocal support.

I want to thank leaders across the world who are standing with Israel today.

I want to thank the people and Congress of the United States of America. 

In fighting Hamas, Israel is not only fighting for its own people.
It is fighting for every country that stands against barbarism.

Israel will win this war, and when Israel wins, the entire civilized world wins"
08.10.2023,"Dear citizens of Israel,

This morning, on Shabbat and a holiday, Hamas invaded Israeli territory and murdered innocent citizens including children and the elderly. Hamas has started a brutal and evil war.

We will be victorious in this war despite an unbearable price. This is a very difficult day for all of us.

Hamas wants to murder us all. This is an enemy that murders children and mothers in their homes, in their beds, an enemy that abducts the elderly, children and young women, that slaughters and massacres our citizens, including children, who simply went out to enjoy the holiday.

What happened today is unprecedented in Israel – and I will see to it that it does not happen again. The entire government is behind this decision.

The IDF will immediately use all its strength to destroy Hamas's capabilities. We will destroy them and we will forcefully avenge this dark day that they have forced on the State of Israel and its citizens. As Bialik wrote (https://allpoetry.com/On-The-Slaughter): 'Revenge for the blood of a little child has yet been devised by Satan'.

All of the places which Hamas is deployed, hiding and operating in, that wicked city, we will turn them into rubble.

I say to the residents of Gaza: Leave now because we will operate forcefully everywhere.

At this hour, the IDF is clearing the terrorists out of the last communities. They are going community by community, house by house, and are restoring our control.

I embrace and send heartfelt condolences to the bereaved families whose loved ones were murdered today in cold blood and endless brutality.

We are all praying for the well-being of the wounded and all those who are being held hostage. I say to Hamas: You are responsible for their well-being. Israel will settle accounts with anyone who harms one hair on their heads.

I appeal to the residents of the south: We all stand alongside you. We are all proud of your heroism and your fighting.

To our beloved IDF soldiers, police officers and security forces personnel, remember that you are the continuation of the heroes of the Jewish people, of Joshua, Judah Maccabee and the heroes of 1948 and of all of Israel's wars. You are now fighting for the home and future of us all. We are all with you. We all love you. We all salute you.

To the medical and rescue teams, and the many volunteers who came out in force today in a long list of places, the people of Israel salute you. With your spirit, we will overcome our enemies.
 
Today, I spoke with US President Biden and with other world leaders in order to ensure freedom of action for Israel in the continuation of the campaign. I thank President Biden for his strong and clear words (https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/10/07/statement-from-president-joe-biden-condemning-terrorist-attacks-in-israel/). I thank the President of France, the Prime Minister of Great Britain and many other leaders for their unreserved support for Israel.

I now appeal to all citizens of Israel. 

We stand together in this campaign.

This war will take time. It will be difficult. Challenging days are ahead of us. However, I can promise one thing: With the help of GOd, the forces that we all have in common and our faith in the Eternal One of Israel, we will win"
07.10.2023,"Following are Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's remarks at the start of the Security Cabinet meeting at the Kirya in Tel Aviv, this afternoon :

""Since this morning, the State of Israel has been at war. Our first objective is to clear out the hostile forces that infiltrated our territory and restore the security and quiet to the communities that have been attacked.

The second objective, at the same time, is to exact an immense price from the enemy, within the Gaza Strip as well. The third objective is to reinforce other fronts so that nobody should mistakenly join this war.

We are at war. In war, one needs to be level-headed. I call on all citizens of Israel to unite in order to achieve our highest goal – victory in the war"
