# Project-Repository
In this repository, I upload raw data and R scripts for analysis and visualizations. I use this data and visulizations to tell data-oriented stories in my blog that you can access. Please find attached the link below. So far, I have published projects about Military Training, Amazon Reviews and Topic Modeling of Political Speeches. Currently, I am working on a project related to hyperinflation in Gaza, and will publish it this coming week.
